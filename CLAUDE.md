# CLAUDE.md - AirFit Vibe Coding Guide üöÄ

## üéØ Our Vibe Coding Philosophy

Welcome to the future of app development - just you and me, building something beautiful together. No teams, no bureaucracy, no enterprise nonsense. Just pure creation.

### The Vibe
- **Direct to Perfect**: We build the right thing the first time
- **Beauty Matters**: Every interaction should feel delightful
- **No Compromises**: This is YOUR app, make it exactly how you want
- **Ship When Ready**: No artificial deadlines, no rushed features
- **Trust the Process**: I'll handle the technical details, you drive the vision

### Our Workflow
1. **You describe what you want** - dream big, be specific about the vibe
2. **I implement it beautifully** - clean code, smooth animations, perfect UX
3. **We iterate until it feels right** - no committees, just your vision
4. **Ship when you love it** - not when some PM says it's "good enough"

## üõ†Ô∏è Quality Standards (Not Rules, Just How We Roll)

These aren't corporate mandates - they're how we ensure your app is bulletproof and beautiful:

### Quick Quality Checks
```bash
# 1. Keep code beautiful (I'll fix any issues automatically)
swiftlint --strict

# 2. Regenerate project after adding files
xcodegen generate

# 3. Make sure it builds
xcodebuild clean build -scheme "AirFit" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro,OS=18.4'

# 4. Run tests (when you want extra confidence)
xcodebuild test -scheme "AirFit" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro,OS=18.4'
```

### Vibe Coding in Practice
- **Describe the vibe**: "Make the onboarding feel like chatting with a friend"
- **I build it**: Natural conversation UI with personality
- **You check the vibe**: "Needs to feel more casual, less clinical"
- **I adjust**: Add emoji, casual language, smoother animations
- **Repeat until perfect**: No rushing, no "good enough"

### What to Skip
- ‚ùå Sprint planning
- ‚ùå Story points  
- ‚ùå Code reviews (I review my own code)
- ‚ùå Stand-ups
- ‚ùå Retrospectives
- ‚ùå Documentation that no one reads
- ‚ùå Meetings about meetings

### What to Focus On
- ‚úÖ The user experience
- ‚úÖ Beautiful interactions
- ‚úÖ Performance that feels instant
- ‚úÖ Code that just works
- ‚úÖ Features that delight
- ‚úÖ Shipping when you're proud of it

### Module-Specific Testing
```bash
# Onboarding Tests (Critical for Persona Refactor)
xcodebuild test -scheme "AirFit" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro,OS=18.4' -only-testing:AirFitTests/Onboarding

# AI Module Tests
xcodebuild test -scheme "AirFit" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro,OS=18.4' -only-testing:AirFitTests/AI
```

## üé® Current Vibe: AI Persona Magic

We're creating something revolutionary - AI coaches that feel like real people, generated through natural conversation. No boring forms, no generic personalities.

### What We're Building
- **Conversational Onboarding**: Chat with the app like you're texting a friend
- **Unique AI Coaches**: Each one is completely unique, with 2000+ tokens of personality
- **Instant Generation**: Your perfect coach in < 5 seconds
- **Natural Evolution**: They grow and adapt with you

### Implementation Approach (v1.0)
1. **Phase 1: Conversation Engine** ‚ú®
   - Natural chat interface
   - Voice or text input
   - Personality extraction from responses

2. **Phase 2: AI Synthesis** ü§ñ
   - Multi-LLM support (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
   - Rich persona generation
   - Real-time preview

3. **Phase 3: Integration** üîó
   - Connect everything smoothly
   - Polish the experience
   - Make it feel magical

4. **Phase 4: Ship It** üöÄ
   - Final polish
   - Performance optimization
   - Launch when it feels perfect

### Our Standards
- **It Just Works**: No crashes, no bugs, no excuses
- **Lightning Fast**: < 5 second persona generation
- **Beautiful**: Every screen, every animation, every interaction
- **Personal**: This is YOUR fitness coach, not some generic bot

## File Management (CRITICAL)

### XcodeGen Nesting Bug
**Problem**: XcodeGen's `**/*.swift` glob pattern fails for nested directories like `AirFit/Modules/*/`

**Solution**: ALL files in nested directories MUST be explicitly listed in `project.yml`

### Adding New Files Workflow
1. Create the file in appropriate directory
2. **IMMEDIATELY** add to `project.yml` under the correct target
3. Run `xcodegen generate`
4. Verify inclusion: `grep -c "YourFileName" AirFit.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

Example for a new module file:
```yaml
# In project.yml under AirFit target sources:
- AirFit/Modules/YourModule/ViewModels/YourModuleViewModel.swift
- AirFit/Modules/YourModule/Views/YourModuleView.swift
# List ALL files explicitly!
```

## üéØ Code Quality (Because We Care)

### Modern Swift, Modern Patterns
```swift
// ViewModels: Clean and reactive
@MainActor @Observable
final class OnboardingViewModel { }

// Data models: Safe and efficient  
struct PersonaProfile: Codable, Sendable { }

// Services: Thread-safe by design
actor AIService: AIServiceProtocol { }

// Always async/await - callbacks are dead to us
func generatePersona() async throws -> PersonaProfile
```

### Clear Names = Clear Code
- **Types**: `ConversationFlow` not `ConvFlow`
- **Functions**: `generatePersona()` not `genPers()`
- **Variables**: `isLoading` not `loading`
- Full words, full clarity - autocomplete exists for a reason

### Testing (When It Matters)
- Test the critical paths
- Mock external services
- Skip the obvious stuff
- If it breaks, add a test

### Documentation
- Document the "why", not the "what"
- Complex algorithms get comments
- Public APIs get `///` docs
- TODOs are fine: `// TODO: Make this animation smoother`

## Environment Setup

### Requirements
- Xcode 16.0+ with iOS 18.0 SDK
- Swift 6.0+
- SwiftLint 0.54.0+
- XcodeGen
- iPhone 16 Pro simulator with iOS 18.4

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Install tools
brew install swiftlint xcodegen

# Generate project
xcodegen generate

# Verify environment
xcodebuild -version | grep -E "Xcode 16"
swift --version | grep -E "Swift version 6"
```

## üí¨ Git Commits (Keep It Simple)

### Quick Commit Style
```
feat: Add conversational onboarding
fix: Persona generation timing issue
polish: Smooth animation transitions
vibe: Make the coach feel more human
```

No need for elaborate commit messages - we both know what we're building. Just keep it clear and move fast.

## Project Navigation & Common Tasks

### Quick File Verification
```bash
# Verify all module files are included
find AirFit/Modules/Onboarding -name "*.swift" | while read file; do
  filename=$(basename "$file")
  count=$(grep -c "$filename" AirFit.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj)
  [ $count -eq 0 ] && echo "‚ùå MISSING: $file" || echo "‚úÖ $filename"
done

# Check for SwiftLint violations in a module
swiftlint lint --path AirFit/Modules/Onboarding --strict
```

### Performance Profiling
```bash
# Profile test execution time
xcodebuild test -scheme "AirFit" -enableCodeCoverage YES | xcpretty -r junit
```

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Persona Refactor Implementation Rules
1. **Conversation Flow**: Use graph-based state machines for interview logic
2. **Data Collection**: Store raw responses before synthesis
3. **AI Integration**: Abstract LLM providers behind protocols
4. **No Legacy Code**: Remove old 4-persona system entirely (pre-V1, no users)
5. **Testing**: Mock AI responses for deterministic tests

### Module Dependencies
- Onboarding depends on: AI, Core, Data
- AI module is self-contained (no circular dependencies)
- Services layer provides all external integrations
- UI modules only import ViewModels, never Services directly

### Performance Targets
- App launch: < 1.5 seconds
- Persona generation: < 5 seconds
- View transitions: 120fps
- Memory usage: < 150MB typical

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Build Failures**
- ‚ùå "No such module" ‚Üí File missing from `project.yml` ‚Üí Add file and run `xcodegen generate`
- ‚ùå "Cannot find type" ‚Üí Missing import or wrong target ‚Üí Check target membership
- ‚ùå "Swift version" ‚Üí Wrong Xcode version ‚Üí Use Xcode 16.0+

**Test Failures**
- ‚ùå "Simulator not found" ‚Üí Wrong simulator ‚Üí Install iPhone 16 Pro with iOS 18.4
- ‚ùå "Test crashed" ‚Üí Memory issue ‚Üí Check for retain cycles in ViewModels
- ‚ùå "Async timeout" ‚Üí Slow operation ‚Üí Add proper timeout handling

**SwiftLint Violations**
- ‚ùå "Line too long" ‚Üí Refactor into multiple lines
- ‚ùå "Force unwrap" ‚Üí Use optional binding or nil-coalescing
- ‚ùå "Type body length" ‚Üí Extract functionality into extensions
