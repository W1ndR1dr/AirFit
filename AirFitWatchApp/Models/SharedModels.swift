// MARK: - Shared Models for Watch Transfer
//
// Purpose: Essential data models shared between iOS and watchOS for workout plan transfer.
// This file should be kept in sync with PlannedWorkoutData.swift in the iOS target.
//
// Important Note: These models are duplicated here for watchOS target compatibility.
// Changes should be made to both files to maintain consistency.
