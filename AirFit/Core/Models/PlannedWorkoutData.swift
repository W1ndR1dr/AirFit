// MARK: - PlannedWorkoutData
//
// Purpose: Transfer models for sending AI-generated workout plans from iOS to watchOS.
// Enables seamless handoff of structured workout data for Apple Watch execution.
//
// Key Features:
// - Codable for WatchConnectivity serialization
/// - Sendable for actor-safe cross-platform transfer
/// - Optimized for efficient watch execution
/// - Preserves AI-generated structure and intelligence
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```swift
/// let plannedWorkout = PlannedWorkoutData(
///     name: "Upper Body Strength",
///     workoutType: WorkoutType.strength.rawValue,
///     plannedExercises: exercises
/// )
///
/// try await transferService.sendWorkoutPlan(plannedWorkout)
/// ```
