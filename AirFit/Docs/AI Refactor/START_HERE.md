# üöÄ Persona Refactor - START HERE

## What We're Building
AI fitness coaches generated through natural conversation. No forms. Just chat naturally and get a unique, personalized coach with 2000+ tokens of personality in <5 seconds.

## Quick Context Load (For AI)
```bash
# 1. Essential docs to read:
cat AirFit/Docs/AI\ Refactor/STATUS_AND_VISION.md     # Current state & target
cat AirFit/Docs/AI\ Refactor/CODEBASE_CONTEXT.md      # What exists
cat AirFit/Docs/AI\ Refactor/COMMON_COMMANDS.md       # Command reference

# 2. Verify environment:
xcodebuild -version | grep "Xcode 16"
swift --version | grep "Swift version 6"

# 3. Check implementation status:
cd /Users/Brian/Coding\ Projects/AirFit
ls -la AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Models/ConversationModels.swift 2>/dev/null || echo "‚ùå Phase 1 not started"

# 4. Read the phase you're implementing:
cat AirFit/Docs/AI\ Refactor/Phase1_ConversationalFoundation.md
```

## Implementation Path
1. **Phase 1**: Build conversation engine (Graph-based flow, natural chat UI)
2. **Phase 2**: Create persona synthesis (Multi-LLM, 2000+ tokens)  
3. **Phase 3**: Integration & testing (SwiftData, performance)
4. **Phase 4**: Polish & ship (Animations, evolution system)

## Key Files
- **Master Guide**: `PERSONA_REFACTOR_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md`
- **Phase Guides**: `Phase1-4_*.md`
- **Status**: `current_status.md` (UPDATE THIS!)
- **Checklist**: `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`

## Vibe Coding Rules
‚úÖ Ship when perfect, not when "done"
‚úÖ Every interaction should delight
‚úÖ Make it beautiful first, optimize later
‚ùå No sprints, estimates, or bureaucracy
‚ùå No "good enough"

## Start Implementing
```bash
# 1. Generate project and verify build
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild clean build -scheme "AirFit" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro,OS=18.4' | tail -20

# 2. Create your first file (example)
mkdir -p AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Models
touch AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Models/ConversationModels.swift

# 3. Add to project.yml IMMEDIATELY
# Edit project.yml and add the file path

# 4. Regenerate and verify
xcodegen generate
grep "ConversationModels" AirFit.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj

# 5. Start coding with vibe!
```

## Success Metrics
- < 5 second persona generation
- Natural conversation flow  
- 100% test coverage on critical paths
- Zero regression on existing features

## Remember
- This is Brian's personal app - make it exactly how he wants
- No legacy users = no compromises  
- Beauty matters as much as function
- If it doesn't feel magical, keep iterating

*Now go build something beautiful!* ‚ú®
