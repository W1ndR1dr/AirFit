# Phase 3 Audit Prompt: Function Dispatcher Cleanup Refactor Validation

**Target Agent Environment:** Sandboxed Codex (No Xcode Available)  
**Execution Priority:** Architectural Quality Gate for Phase 3  
**Parent Document:** `Phase3_FunctionDispatcher_Refactor.md`

## Executive Summary

This audit validates the completion of Phase 3: Function Dispatcher Cleanup Refactor, which eliminates unnecessary complexity in the 854-line FunctionCallDispatcher by replacing simple parsing functions with direct AI calls while preserving complex workflow capabilities. This phase provides architectural cleanup and performance improvements after the infrastructure foundation from Phases 1-2.

**Core Validation Goals:**
- ✅ Verify target functions migrated to direct AI calls
- ✅ Confirm intelligent routing logic preserves function chaining
- ✅ Validate 50% code reduction achieved (854 → ~400 lines)
- ✅ Ensure 3x performance improvement for parsing tasks
- ✅ Check 90% token reduction for simple tasks
- ✅ Verify function calling ecosystem coherence maintained
