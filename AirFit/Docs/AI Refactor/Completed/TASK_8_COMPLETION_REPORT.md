## Success Criteria Validation

### ✅ Real Nutrition Data
- **Before:** Everything returned 100 calories (broken)
- **After:** Different foods return different, realistic nutrition values
- **Validation:** Tests verify apple ≠ pizza calories

### ✅ Performance Targets Met
- **Target:** <3 seconds for voice-to-nutrition flow
- **Tests:** Performance integration tests validate timing
- **Result:** Consistently meets performance requirements

### ✅ Error Recovery Works
- **Edge Cases:** Invalid input, empty text, AI failures
- **Fallback:** Intelligent fallback system provides reasonable defaults
- **User Experience:** Graceful error handling maintained

### ✅ No Regression
- **Existing Features:** All preserved and working
- **UI Integration:** Coordinator navigation maintained
- **Data Operations:** Database operations unchanged and working

### ✅ End-to-End Functionality
- **Flow:** Voice → AI Parsing → Confirmation → Save
- **Integration:** Real CoachEngine used in tests
- **Validation:** Complete user journey tested
