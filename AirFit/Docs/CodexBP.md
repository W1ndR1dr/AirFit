# Structuring Swift Project Repositories for Codex Agent Autonomy

Developing an iOS/watchOS/macOS app with AI assistance means preparing your project like a roadmap for a new engineer – except the engineer is an OpenAI Codex agent. By thoughtfully organizing your repository, providing clear documentation, and enforcing quality checks, you enable the Codex agent to work more effectively and autonomously. This guide outlines best practices to maximize Codex compatibility, reliability, and adherence to your plans.

## Repository Layout and File Organization

A clean, logical project structure helps the Codex agent “understand” your app. Use a standard Swift/Apple project layout and group related components together. For example, an Xcode-based app might be structured as follows:

```plaintext
MyApp/
├── MyApp.xcodeproj                # Xcode project file 
├── Sources/ (or MyApp/)
│   ├── Models/                    # Data model definitions
│   ├── Views/                     # UI components (SwiftUI views or UIKit views)
│   ├── ViewModels/                # ViewModel or Controller classes
│   ├── Services/                  # Networking or data services
│   └── App.swift                  # App entry point (SwiftUI App or UIApplicationDelegate)
├── Tests/
│   └── MyAppTests/                # Unit tests for MyApp target
├── Design.md                      # High-level app design document
├── ArchitectureOverview.md        # System architecture and module relationships
├── ModuleA.md, ModuleB.md         # Detailed specs for specific modules/features
└── AGENTS.md                      # Instructions and configuration for Codex agent
```

**Organize by feature or layer:** Create directories for app layers or features (e.g. Models, Views, etc.) so the agent can easily locate relevant code. A well-named folder (such as `Networking/` or `Database/`) signals the scope of that code. This mirrors how human developers navigate projects and helps Codex find the right context. It’s also wise to mirror this structure in Xcode’s groups for clarity.

**Include a single source of truth for config:** If your app spans multiple platforms (iOS, watchOS, etc.), consider shared code via Swift Packages or frameworks. Keep platform-specific code in separate targets/folders while sharing common modules. For example, you might have `Shared/` for logic used on all platforms, and platform folders like `iOS/` and `watchOS/` for UI or platform-specific files. Clearly separate these in the repository so Codex doesn’t confuse platform targets.

**Commit all required files:** Make sure to check in important configuration files like the Xcode project (`.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace`), `Package.swift` (if using SwiftPM), and any dependency manifests (e.g. `Podfile` and `Podfile.lock` if you use CocoaPods). The Codex agent’s sandbox will clone your repository – it needs all files to build and test. For example, if you use Swift Package Manager, include the `Package.resolved` so dependencies’ versions are known. If using CocoaPods, commit your Podfile and lockfile; you may even commit the `Pods/` directory if network access is restricted (more on this below). The goal is a repository that can be built and tested in isolation.

## Documentation: Design Plans and Markdown Guidelines

The Codex agent performs best when *“provided with configured dev environments, reliable testing setups, and clear documentation”*. In practice, this means writing out your plans in Markdown files and commenting your code so the agent has explicit guidance. Treat your documentation as if writing to a human developer – because Codex will read it much like one.

**Project planning docs:** Include your high-level design and architecture plans in the repo (`Design.md`, `ArchitectureOverview.md`, etc.). These should describe the app’s objectives, major components, and how the pieces fit together. Use clear headings and bullet lists for requirements or user stories, so the agent can easily parse them. For example, in **ArchitectureOverview\.md**, you might list each module (feature) with its purpose and any interactions with other modules. In **ModuleX.md**, enumerate that module’s responsibilities and acceptance criteria as bullet points or a checklist. This explicit structure helps the agent break down tasks according to your plan.

*Example:* A `ModuleX.md` could include a section like:

* **Purpose:** “Module X handles user authentication flow (login/logout) using OAuth.”
* **Components:** “Includes `AuthService` (network calls), `AuthViewModel`, and UI in `AuthView.swift`.”
* **Acceptance Criteria:** a bullet list of specific outcomes (e.g., “If credentials are invalid, an error alert is shown”; “Persist auth token securely in Keychain”).

By frontloading such detail, you equip the agent to implement exactly what you envisioned. Codex does not spontaneously know your app’s intent – you must spell it out.

**Writing style in docs:** Use simple, unambiguous language. Prefer declarative statements (“The Search module **must** cache results locally after each query”) over vague ones (“Search should maybe remember past results”). If there are specific algorithms or data flows, describe them step-by-step or with simple pseudo-code in fenced code blocks. For instance, include an outline of a function in Markdown if it’s complex:

```markdown
**Algorithm (pseudo-code)**:
```

```
// fetch data from API 
// if response OK -> parse JSON -> update model 
// if error -> retry 3 times then show error message
```

The agent can use this as a blueprint for the real implementation. Diagrams can help you clarify ideas (for human collaborators), but remember the agent itself cannot directly interpret an image. Supplement any diagram with text explanation. For instance, if you draw an architecture diagram of modules, also list the relationships in text form.

**Commenting in code:** Within source files, write comments to guide tricky parts. Document each public class or function with a Swift documentation comment (`///`) explaining its role. If you leave stub functions for the agent to fill in, include a `// TODO:` comment describing what needs to happen. The agent will see those and can follow the instructions. For example:

```swift
// TODO: Validate input format and throw InputError if invalid
func processUserInput(_ text: String) -> ParsedData { ... }
```

This reduces ambiguity. Also use comments to warn about pitfalls or preferred approaches (e.g., `// Note: Use recursion here because ...`). By providing these semantic cues, you steer the agent away from common mistakes.

**Markdown patterns for clarity:** In your planning docs, use consistent formatting. Utilize headings (`##`, `###`) for sections like “Overview”, “Requirements”, “Implementation Plan”. Use **bold** or *italics* to highlight must-haves or important terms. Numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`) can outline step-by-step workflows the agent should implement in order. A clear, well-structured markdown file is essentially a pseudo-spec the agent will try to follow. Codex can even be prompted in ChatGPT’s interface with an “Ask” to summarize or clarify parts of your docs if needed.

Lastly, consider mentioning your documentation files in the **AGENTS.md** (discussed next) or the initial task prompt so the agent knows they exist. For example, in AGENTS.md you might add: “Refer to Design.md and ArchitectureOverview\.md for overall plan and follow all listed requirements.” This acts as a pointer for the agent to consult those files during its runs.

## Using `AGENTS.md` as the AI’s Playbook

OpenAI Codex supports a special repository file called **AGENTS.md** that customizes the agent’s behavior. This file is analogous to a project README but specifically for the AI. Here you will guide Codex on how to navigate, build, test, and adhere to your project’s conventions. The Codex agent **looks for an `AGENTS.md` in your repo and “reads” it like a developer would, following any instructions or commands inside**. Making full use of this file is critical for autonomous agents.

**Placement:** Put a top-level `AGENTS.md` in your repository root (the agent will automatically pick it up). You can also have additional `AGENTS.md` files in subdirectories for module-specific guidance – for example, `Networking/AGENTS.md` with special instructions just for networking code. The agent merges these instructions, with more deeply nested files taking precedence for their scope. In most cases a single root `AGENTS.md` is sufficient, but if you have distinct subsystems, nested agent docs can fine-tune behavior per component.

**What to include:** `AGENTS.md` should cover at least the following areas:

* **Build/Test Commands:** Provide the exact commands the agent should run to build or test your app. Codex can run shell commands in its sandbox, so tell it how to verify its work. For a Swift project, this might be a command to run unit tests. For example, you might include:

  ```markdown
  ## Build & Test
  run: xcodebuild -scheme "MyApp" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14,OS=latest' test
  ```

  This instructs the agent to run your Xcode tests on an iOS simulator. If your project is a Swift Package, you could use `run: swift test`. Likewise, if you have integration tests or other checks, list them here. The agent will execute each `run:` command and use the results to decide if its code changes are successful. In fact, *if `AGENTS.md` includes programmatic checks (like test commands), the agent is expected to run them all and only finish when they pass*. This guarantees that code generation isn’t done until your tests and build succeed.

* **Linting/Formatting:** If you use a linter or formatter, include it too. For example, if you use SwiftLint, add a line: `run: swiftlint` (assuming SwiftLint is available in the environment). Make sure to also provide any config file (like `.swiftlint.yml`) in the repo so the agent knows your style rules. By running a linter, Codex can catch style issues and fix them before proposing a commit, aligning the AI’s output with your style guide. *(Note:* The Codex sandbox may not have every tool installed by default; we address this in the Environment Setup section below.)

* **Project Conventions:** Describe your coding standards and conventions so the agent follows them. This can include naming conventions, architectural patterns, or any “rules of the road” for your code. For Swift, you might specify things like “Use `UpperCamelCase` for type names and `lowerCamelCase` for variables and functions”, “Prefer structs over classes for value types”, “Use protocol-oriented patterns for abstraction”. If you require design patterns (e.g. “UI must use MVVM with SwiftUI”), state that. These guidelines ensure consistency in agent-generated code. For example:

  ```markdown
  ## Coding Guidelines
  - Follow Swift API Design Guidelines (clear names, camelCase, etc.).
  - Use SwiftUI for new UI screens and adhere to MVVM pattern (one ViewModel per View).
  - Networking must use `URLSession` with asynchronous/await calls (no 3rd party frameworks).
  - Include doc comments (`///`) for public APIs and any complex logic.
  ```

  By listing these, you essentially “train” the agent on your project’s style. Codex’s model is already aligned with common coding standards, but being explicit avoids any doubt. As OpenAI notes, Codex was trained to produce code aligned with human preferences and standards – providing your specific preferences in `AGENTS.md` sharpens this alignment.

* **Testing Protocols:** Be clear about how to run tests and what frameworks are in use. For an iOS app, indicate if you’re using the XCTest framework (default for Xcode). If certain test suites or coverage checks must pass, mention them. For example: “All new code must be covered by unit tests in `Tests/` target. Run `xcodebuild test` to execute tests. Ensure 100% of tests pass.” If the agent knows the testing requirements, it can even generate new tests for new features and run them. In fact, Codex is capable of writing tests if instructed, or you can pre-write failing tests and let the agent make them pass. Use whichever approach fits – just communicate it in the documentation.

* **Pull Request / Commit Guidelines:** If you plan to have Codex open pull requests or commits, include instructions for the commit messages or PR description. For example, you can specify: “When opening a PR, include a summary of changes, link to issue (if any), and `Fixes #IssueNum` in the description.” The agent will follow these when drafting PR messages. If you want atomic, focused commits, you could instruct “Each task/PR should only address one feature or bugfix – no mixed changes”. By encoding your team’s workflow rules here, you get consistent output even from an autonomous agent.

In summary, `AGENTS.md` is your primary control layer for the AI. Keep it comprehensive but concise. Many users find that Codex “performs best in structured environments” and that *adding an AGENTS.md with project-specific commands, standards, and quirks significantly improves results*. Treat it as a living document: if you notice the agent making a certain mistake repeatedly, update `AGENTS.md` to address it.

## Ensuring Build & Test Reliability (Linters, CI and Feedback)

For agent autonomy, **make the feedback loop automated**. The Codex agent can run tests and analysis tools as it works, so set those tools up to catch mistakes. This reduces the need for you to intervene or catch errors manually. Here are best practices for a Swift project:

* **Automated Tests as Acceptance Criteria:** Nothing keeps an AI on track like failing tests. Before you let Codex implement a module, consider writing unit tests that define the expected behavior. As a non-developer planner, you might write these tests in plain English (in the module spec) and have the agent convert them to code, or you could let the agent write tests itself. Either way, insist on tests. Codex will iterate running tests until they all pass. For example, if you’re delegating a “Login feature” to the agent, include in **Module\_Login.md** the scenarios that must pass (“valid credentials -> navigate to Home screen”, etc.), and even better, include a `LoginTests.swift` with skeleton test cases. The agent can fill in the implementation until those tests succeed. This approach leads to *“the agent iteratively running code and tests until a correct solution is reached”*, much like Test-Driven Development on autopilot.

* **Use SwiftLint or Similar:** Consistent code style is not just aesthetic – it prevents many simple bugs and makes code reviews easier. If you integrate **SwiftLint**, list its execution in `AGENTS.md` (and ensure the tool is available to the agent). Define a lint rule set (in `.swiftlint.yml`) to enforce things like unused variable warnings, force unwrapping bans, etc. The agent will attempt to fix any lint violations it encounters. For example, if you have a rule against force-unwrapping optionals, the agent, upon seeing a lint error, will refactor the code to remove `!` usages. This kind of feedback-driven refinement leads to cleaner, more robust code. *Note:* The agent’s container likely won’t have SwiftLint pre-installed. However, you can utilize the Codex environment setup to install it (discussed below). Once available, a simple `run: swiftlint` in `AGENTS.md` ensures it runs every cycle.

* **Continuous Integration (CI) mindset:** Even though Codex runs in its own sandbox, treat each agent task like a CI pipeline: build, test, lint, then “deliver” code. You might not have a traditional CI server here, but the agent is effectively performing those checks for you. Still, it’s wise to double-check with your own CI after the agent’s work is done. For example, if you use GitHub, you can have a GitHub Action run `xcodebuild test` on the PR that Codex opens. This is a safety net in case something slipped past the agent. In an ideal setup, the agent’s output already passes all checks by design – but verifying independently ensures nothing was missed, especially in early experiments.

* **Static analysis and Type Checking:** Swift’s compiler will catch type errors at build time. Make sure the agent compiles the code after changes (if you provided a test command, that usually includes compilation). If you have additional static analysis (like using Xcode’s analyze feature or a tool like SwiftLint’s static analysis), incorporate that. For instance, you could include a command `run: xcodebuild -scheme "MyApp" analyze` for static analysis. Also, if using Swift Package Manager, `swift build` or `swift build --warnings-as-errors` can be run. The Codex agent can run these and will attempt to fix any compilation errors or warnings. It was trained to handle iterative fixing until the build is clean. Don’t hesitate to enforce a zero-warning policy – the agent will conform if it knows it must.

* **Human-readable output:** While the agent will do the heavy lifting, as the repository owner you’ll eventually review the code. Encourage the agent (via guidelines) to produce code that is readable and well-commented. For example, in `AGENTS.md` you might add: “All significant functions should have a brief comment explaining their purpose.” The agent can then include Swift doc comments in its output. This makes your later review and understanding easier. It also means if you run Codex’s “Ask” mode with questions about the code, those doc comments assist the model in answering accurately. In short, invest in clarity even in generated code – it pays off in fewer misunderstandings.

## Naming, Abstraction, and Modular Design Strategies

Codex is most effective when implementing well-defined, decoupled components. By using clear naming and interface abstraction, you make it easier for the AI to maintain project fidelity:

* **Adopt Consistent Naming Conventions:** Use standard Swift naming conventions throughout your plan and any starter code. The agent has been trained on typical Swift style, so sticking to those helps it meet your expectations. For example, class and struct names in PascalCase (e.g. `UserProfileManager`), method and variable names in camelCase (`loadUserData()`), and constants or enum cases in lowerCamelCase (`case active`). Avoid ambiguous or overly abbreviated names in your specs – what’s obvious to you might confuse the AI. Instead of “Mgr” or “Util”, use full words like “Manager” or a descriptive term. If your project has unique naming schemes (perhaps prefixing all UI controls with your project acronym), document that in `AGENTS.md` or a style section. The agent will replicate it. Consistent naming not only improves code quality but also helps the agent match new code to existing patterns, reducing integration friction.

* **Protocol-Oriented Design:** Swift’s protocol-oriented paradigm can be leveraged to keep modules autonomous. Define protocols for functionality that might be implemented by different modules or mocked in tests. For instance, you could define a protocol `AuthenticationService` with methods like `login()` and `logout()`, and have both a real implementation and a test/mock implementation. If you outline these protocols in your architecture doc, the agent will understand the intended abstraction. *Why this helps:* The agent can implement each module against the protocol without needing the concrete implementation of the other. It encourages the agent to write modular code (one of your goals). It also simplifies testing – the agent can inject a mock conforming to the protocol in unit tests. In practice, you might write in **ArchitectureOverview\.md**: “Networking layer implements `NetworkClientProtocol` for fetching data; UI layer uses this protocol, allowing swapping in a `MockNetworkClient` in tests.” The agent will pick up on that and likely follow suit, creating a `MockNetworkClient` when writing tests. This pattern of **dependency injection** via protocols is a best practice for human devs and equally beneficial for AI devs.

* **Mocking and Testing Patterns:** As a non-developer, you can set the expectation that code will be tested in isolation. Encourage use of dependency injection and mocking so that, for example, your UI code isn’t hitting real network calls during tests. You can specify in `AGENTS.md` or tests guidelines: “Network calls should be abstracted; write a Mock that returns sample data for tests.” The agent can then generate a simple mock object. If you know of common Swift mocking frameworks (like Cuckoo or using Xcode’s built-in `Protocol Stub` feature), you could mention them. However, the agent might not have those tools installed, so a plain protocol + fake implementation approach is safest. Also consider using Swift’s `@testable import` and giving the agent permission (via instructions) to extend classes or use dependency injection in initializers for testability. The more test-friendly the architecture, the more effectively Codex can verify and correct its work without human intervention.

* **Small, Focused Functions:** In your planning guidance, emphasize that each function or struct should have a single responsibility (this aligns with Clean Code principles). Codex has a tendency to produce concise, logically-contained functions when following good design. You can even instruct: “Avoid very large functions – refactor into smaller helpers if necessary.” This way, if the agent generates a 100-line function, it might recall your guideline and break it into smaller pieces. This modularity reduces the chance of errors and makes it easier for the agent to reason about the code (and for you to later understand it).

By setting these standards, you’ll find that *“embracing software engineering fundamentals and having good taste increases leverage”* even when using AI. In other words, the more your project follows solid design principles, the more the Codex agent will excel in extending and maintaining it.

## Environment Setup and Dependency Management

One challenge with autonomous agents is ensuring the development environment matches your project’s needs. Codex runs your tasks in a cloud container preloaded with your repository. However, that container may be minimal by default (to keep startup fast). By default the agent has no internet access during task execution, so it cannot download dependencies or tools on the fly unless we plan for it.

**Using Codex environment configuration:** In the Codex interface, you can configure a setup script or image for the container. This script runs *before* the agent starts coding, and it *does* have internet access during that initial setup window. Use this wisely. For an iOS app, your environment likely needs Xcode (or at least the Xcode command-line tools) and possibly other utilities like CocoaPods, Mint, etc. OpenAI’s documentation might already provide a macOS environment with Xcode for Swift tasks – confirm this in their official docs or forums. If not, you can specify an environment that includes Xcode or the Swift toolchain. If your project uses **CocoaPods**, for example, you could add to the setup script: `gem install cocoapods && pod install`. If you use **homebrew** packages (like SwiftLint via Homebrew), you could `brew install swiftlint`. One user noted success doing apt-get or pip installs via the environment config, whereas trying to install within the Codex task itself will fail. So, set up everything the project needs *in advance*.

**Vendoring dependencies:** If external network access is a concern or not working, consider vendoring (including the source code of) critical dependencies in your repo. For SwiftPM packages, you might check them out into, say, a `Dependencies/` folder and adjust your project to use that, so no external fetch is needed. This is heavy-handed but guarantees the agent has what it needs. A simpler approach is to run the dependency manager *beforehand* and commit the artifacts: e.g., commit the `Pods/` directory after running `pod install`, or commit the `.xcframework` binaries of any libraries. This way, the agent’s container doesn’t need to download anything – it can directly build and link against those. As an example, an early Codex user working with Ruby on Rails found the agent couldn’t install packages on the fly, saying *“there’s no way to install Ruby \[or other packages]… I wouldn’t waste time unless you have a very simple app which doesn’t need anything other than their base container”*. The workaround was using the environment config to pre-install needed packages. For Swift apps, ensure that what’s needed is either in the base macOS image or in your setup script.

**Specify tools versions:** If your project requires a specific Swift version or Xcode version (perhaps due to SwiftUI or SDK requirements), note that in documentation. The agent’s environment should match to avoid subtle issues. If OpenAI allows selecting an Xcode version, choose the correct one for your iOS SDK. If not, you may need to adjust your code to be compatible with the default. Also mention platform version requirements (e.g., “iOS 17 SDK”). The agent might attempt to use newer APIs that aren’t available if the environment’s Xcode is older, or vice versa, so aligning this is important. In `AGENTS.md` or **ArchitectureOverview\.md**, you could include a “Environment” section, e.g.: “Project uses Swift 5.8 and iOS 16.0 Deployment Target. Ensure any code uses only APIs available in iOS 16 or uses `#available` checks appropriately.” This hints the agent to avoid, say, calling an iOS 17-only API without guard.

**Monitor resource usage:** Codex tasks can take 1 to 30 minutes depending on complexity. If you see tasks timing out or running slowly, it might be due to large dependencies or too many tests running. You can adjust by splitting tests (maybe instruct the agent to run a focused subset relevant to its change, if running the entire suite is too slow every time). Also be mindful of context size – codex-1 reportedly supports up to \~192k tokens context, which is huge (far more than GPT-4’s typical context). But extremely large projects might approach that. If your repository is very large, consider focusing the agent on one module at a time (you can achieve this by running tasks in subdirectories or by having an `AGENTS.md` in subfolders that limits scope). In practice, OpenAI even tested Codex on an internal monorepo and is working to support very large, multi-repo setups, so it can handle breadth – but you can help by avoiding requiring one task to understand *everything* at once.

## Handling Agent Limitations and Failure Modes

Even with ideal preparation, Codex is not infallible. It’s a cutting-edge AI developer, but as one early adopter noted, *“it gets stuck, can’t fix problems, and the cloud model has drawbacks… cool when it works, but not a replacement for better tools yet.”*. In this section, we outline common failure modes and how to mitigate them:

* **Misinterpretation of Requirements:** The agent might sometimes misread your instructions or implement a feature incorrectly if the spec is ambiguous. Mitigation: make requirements testable and explicit. Instead of saying “optimize performance”, say “the app must handle 10,000 items without lag (test by loading 10k items in a list)” – something concrete. If the agent still veers off, you can use the ChatGPT “Ask” mode to query the agent about its understanding before coding. For example, “Explain the design of Module X in your own words” – see if it matches your intent. Correct misunderstandings by refining the docs or adding clarifications in `AGENTS.md`. Codex doesn’t have long-term memory across separate tasks beyond what’s in the repo, so each task relies on the written instructions at hand. Keep those instructions up-to-date and clear.

* **Getting Stuck in a Loop:** Occasionally, Codex might hit a scenario where tests keep failing and it’s unable to find a solution within the task time. This could happen if the problem is particularly tricky or the tests are very strict. If you notice an agent task taking too long or not making progress (you can monitor logs in real time), intervene by stopping the task. Consider breaking the problem into smaller pieces. You can simplify a test to allow incremental progress, then later tighten it. Another tactic is to give a gentle hint via the prompt: e.g., “Hint: consider using a binary search algorithm to optimize this function.” Since you as the user can provide an additional prompt if needed (between Codex runs), a well-timed hint can save a stuck agent. However, the goal is minimal intervention – so ideally, your initial docs and tests should have guided it. As you gain experience, you’ll learn which patterns cause trouble and can preemptively document solutions (or avoid overly constraining the first attempt).

* **Outdated Knowledge:** Codex’s model knowledge (codex-1) has a training cutoff (likely somewhere in 2023/2024). It *does not have access to live internet or up-to-date Apple documentation during its runs*. This means if you’re using a brand-new Swift library or API that the model hasn’t seen, it might guess or use an outdated approach. Mitigation: include references or code examples for new APIs in your docs. For instance, if you need to use a new SwiftUI 2025 widget, paste a snippet from Apple’s documentation into ArchitectureOverview\.md so the agent sees the proper usage. Alternatively, be prepared to correct these mistakes in code review – but if you catch them in tests (e.g., the code doesn’t compile because a called method doesn’t exist), the agent will attempt a fix. You can also explicitly instruct: “Do not use deprecated APIs; target iOS 16 APIs only,” etc., to keep it within known territory.

* **Complex UI or Multistep flows:** The agent can handle UI code (it can write SwiftUI or UIKit code) but verifying UI behavior is harder with automated tests. A failure mode might be a UI that looks correct to the agent but isn’t quite right visually or UX-wise. Since Codex can’t “see” the UI, it relies on any SwiftUI preview tests or unit tests you have, which are limited. To mitigate this, define UI requirements in tests as much as possible (for example, a UI test that checks that a button becomes disabled after tap). Additionally, after the agent’s code is delivered, run the app yourself (or have QA) to catch UI issues. You might then write a new test for any UI bug found and have Codex fix it. This way, over time, your test suite grows to cover UI behaviors too.

* **Integration and Coordination issues:** If you let Codex run multiple tasks in parallel (it’s possible – Codex can work on many tasks in parallel branches), you might face merge conflicts or integration issues. For example, two tasks might modify the same file in different ways. At this stage (2025), it’s safer to run tasks sequentially or in isolated parts of the code to avoid complex merges. If you do parallelize, ensure each task is well-scoped to different modules. The *“propose 3 PRs”* feature is interesting – the agent may suggest multiple independent changes – but coordinate them carefully. If conflicts occur, you can either resolve them manually or spin up another Codex task to do the merge (with careful oversight). For now, the simpler approach is one thing at a time.

* **Over-reliance on Agent – maintain human oversight:** Codex significantly accelerates development, but you as the project owner should still review changes. The agent provides *“citations of terminal logs and test outputs”* for transparency. Take advantage of this: examine the diff, read the test results, and ensure the solution truly meets the spirit of the requirement. If something looks off, you can prompt Codex for a revision (e.g., “Please refactor this to use XYZ approach as per design doc”). Remember that *“it remains essential for users to manually review and validate all agent-generated code before integration”*. This is a fundamental safety step.

In short, anticipate where the agent might falter and have safeguards. With each hiccup, improve your docs or tests so it doesn’t happen next time. Many early users note that while Codex is extremely powerful, it may need a bit of guidance on novel or complex tasks – think of it as a very fast junior developer who sometimes needs mentorship. Your planning and structure are that mentorship.

## Continuously Improving the `AGENTS.md` Control Layer

Finally, treat **AGENTS.md** as an evolving “AI team lead” that enforces your best practices. Each project is unique, so over time you’ll refine this file to get even better results from Codex. Here are tips for turning `AGENTS.md` into a superior control layer:

* **Keep it DRY and focused:** Don’t overload the agent with irrelevant info. `AGENTS.md` should be focused on rules and processes, not feature requirements (those go in your design docs). The agent merges this file with its system prompts, so make every line count. Use bullet points or short sections for each concern (tests, style, etc.) rather than long-winded paragraphs. The example from an official quick-start shows a terse style: listing commands under headings and a few concise guidelines. This structured brevity helps the agent parse instructions quickly.

* **Update it based on agent behavior:** Did the agent produce a messy commit message? Add a rule in `AGENTS.md` about commit formatting. Did it forget to update a related file (e.g., changed a model but not a corresponding UI)? Add a note: “If a data model changes, ensure all dependent views or controllers are updated accordingly.” The next time, it will take that into account. The agent is deterministic in following these project-specific rules – if you tell it, it will usually comply. Think of `AGENTS.md` as programming the AI’s style and process rather than its code output.

* **Leverage hierarchy for complex projects:** As mentioned, you can have multiple `AGENTS.md` files in different folders. Advanced use-case: Suppose your repository includes an **iOS app** and a separate **Server** folder for a Vapor backend (Swift server). You might use one `AGENTS.md` at root for general conventions (naming, PR guidelines) and separate ones in `iOS/` and `Server/` with platform-specific build/test commands and coding styles. This way the agent, when working in `iOS/`, follows iOS-specific guidance, and likewise for server tasks. The Codex system will automatically apply the nearest relevant `AGENTS.md` (nested files override higher-level instructions in case of conflict). This is powerful for multi-tier projects.

* **Incorporate programmatic verification:** We touched on this, but it’s worth reiterating: use `AGENTS.md` not just to *tell* the agent what to do, but to *check* that it did it. Each “run:” command or specified test is essentially an assertion that the agent must satisfy. If you have any custom script to verify something (for example, a script to ensure no API keys are accidentally hard-coded), you can include it. For instance: `run: scripts/check_no_keys.sh`. If that script exits non-zero, the agent will treat it like a failing test and try to fix the code (in this case, perhaps removing a hard-coded key it introduced). This elevates `AGENTS.md` to a guardrail system ensuring the agent’s autonomy doesn’t break certain rules. As the official spec notes, the agent *“provides verifiable evidence of its actions through citations of logs and test outputs”* – by adding more automated checks, you increase that verifiability.

* **Document known edge cases:** If your project has quirks – say, “Feature X is temporary and will be removed in June” or “Module Y uses an old library that should not be modified” – you can put this in `AGENTS.md` as a caution. The agent then knows to perhaps skip touching certain code. For example: “Do not modify files under Legacy/ directory; those are deprecated.” Without this, the well-intentioned AI might refactor code in `Legacy/` if a lint rule flags it. Explicitly tell it not to, if that’s desired. In general, listing *don’ts* alongside *dos* can be very effective in controlling AI output.

* **Stay updated with Codex improvements:** OpenAI is likely to refine Codex and the `AGENTS.md` format over time. Since the initial release (May 16, 2025), community forums and updates might introduce new capabilities – for instance, maybe future Codex versions will allow conditional logic in `AGENTS.md` or support a richer syntax. Keep an eye on official documentation or the developer forum. Early adopters share tips on Reddit and OpenAI’s forums (for example, how they format `AGENTS.md` for best results). Adapting those insights will keep your project on the cutting edge. Remember, *2025 is considered “the year of AI agents”*, and things are evolving fast. Continuously polishing your approach means you’ll harness each improvement to further reduce the need for human correction.

## Conclusion

By structuring your Swift project repository with clear organization, thorough documentation, automated tests, and an effective `AGENTS.md` file, you create an environment where OpenAI Codex agents can truly shine. Your role shifts to defining *what* to build and *how* it should look at a high level, while the AI handles the *implementation details* under the guardrails you’ve set.

This collaboration works best when you treat the Codex agent like a diligent junior developer: it will follow your project’s “playbook” to the letter, run every required check, and produce output aligned with human-like coding standards. You, as the project lead, ensure that playbook is comprehensive and up-to-date. When you do, the results are remarkable – features built in minutes, bugs fixed on the fly, and a development velocity that lets you focus on vision rather than syntax.

As you apply the best practices from this guide, continue to iterate on your process. Soon you’ll find an optimal balance where your OpenAI Codex agent operates with a high degree of autonomy, and your software project maintains a high degree of quality. With well-structured repositories and smart planning, **AI agents can become reliable partners in Swift app development**, turning your detailed plans into working code with minimal hand-holding. Happy coding with your new AI teammate!
