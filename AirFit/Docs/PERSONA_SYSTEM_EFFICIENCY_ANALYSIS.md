# Persona System Efficiency Analysis

## Domain 2: Persona Engine Optimization

**Date:** January 2025

**Objective:** Reduce the complexity and token usage of the PersonaEngine while maintaining a personalized coaching experience.

### Current State Overview
- `PersonaEngine.swift` contains ~374 lines of logic for dynamic persona adjustments.
- System prompt templates inject ~2000 tokens per request to model the user’s coaching style.
- Onboarding collects detailed persona configuration which feeds into continuous blend calculations.

### Observed Issues
- **High Token Cost:** Excessive prompt length increases API costs and latency.
- **Overly Granular Adjustments:** Small incremental changes (e.g., 0.15 blends) may be imperceptible to users.
- **Complex Onboarding Flow:** Detailed persona sliders add friction without clear value.

### Key Questions
1. Which persona adjustments are noticeable and valuable to users?
2. Can we provide 80% of the personalization with 20% of the tokens?
3. Are discrete persona modes more effective than mathematical blending?
4. How can onboarding be streamlined while still capturing essential persona choices?

### Preliminary Recommendations
- **Token Optimization:** Trim the system prompt and experiment with concise persona templates. Aim for a 70% reduction in token usage.
- **Simplified Persona Modes:** Offer 3–5 predefined persona styles (e.g., Encouraging, Direct, Playful) instead of fine-grained blends.
- **Runtime Efficiency:** Cache persona prompts and avoid recalculating blends unless the user explicitly changes settings.
- **Onboarding Integration:** Replace complex sliders with a short quiz to select a base persona, then allow optional fine-tuning later.

### Next Steps
1. Instrument the current PersonaEngine to log token counts and response times.
2. Prototype a simplified engine with predefined personas and measure user perception via A/B tests.
3. Document migration steps for transitioning existing users to the new system.

### Success Metrics
- **Token Reduction:** 70% decrease in prompt size while maintaining personality distinctiveness.
- **User Perception:** Test groups report equal or improved satisfaction with simplified personas.
- **Runtime Efficiency:** Faster prompt generation and lower memory usage during persona calculations.
