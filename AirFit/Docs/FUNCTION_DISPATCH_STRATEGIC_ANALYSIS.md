### 1. Current State Overview
- **Dispatch Complexity:** The `FunctionCallDispatcher` spans more than 850 lines and handles every possible AI function invocation.
- **Mock Implementations:** Numerous mock services exist solely to satisfy the dispatcher, creating maintenance overhead.
- **Performance Footprint:** Logging shows high latency when dispatching through multiple layers.

### 2. Problem Statement
The current design treats all AI interactions uniformly, routing simple text parsing and complex multi-step workflows through the same infrastructure. This adds latency and code bloat without proportional user value.

### 3. Goals
1. **Strategic Function Usage:** Reserve structured function calls for scenarios where they offer clear benefit (e.g., multi-step workflows, external integrations).
2. **Direct AI Interaction for Simple Tasks:** Use concise prompts for basic parsing and classification tasks.
3. **Maintain Extensibility:** Keep the ability to add new functions without rewriting large portions of the system.

### 4. Analysis Questions
1. Which existing functions deliver measurable user value versus those that merely reformat data?
2. Can we categorize functions into "workflow", "data parsing", and "utility" to apply different strategies?
3. What percentage of current tasks could be handled with direct AI prompts while maintaining accuracy?
4. How can we redesign the dispatcher to be modular, enabling selective engagement?

### 5. Proposed Approach
- **Task Classification Framework:** Map each AI task to one of three categories—workflow, parsing, or utility—then decide if it needs structured function execution.
- **Lightweight Dispatcher:** Replace the monolithic dispatcher with a registry that only wires tasks requiring workflows. Simple parsing functions become thin convenience wrappers over direct AI calls.
- **Deprecation of Mock Services:** Remove mock implementations that simulate simple parsing; rely on test fixtures or recorded responses instead.
- **Metrics & Evaluation:** Instrument new dispatcher paths to measure latency improvements and token savings.

### 6. Success Metrics
- **Dispatcher Size Reduction:** Target a 70% decrease in lines of code.
- **Token Efficiency:** Reduce tokens used by parsing tasks by at least 80%.
- **Latency Improvement:** Cut dispatch latency for simple tasks to under 100ms.
- **Maintenance Simplicity:** Fewer mocks and clearer separation of concerns.

### 7. Next Steps
1. Audit all existing function calls and categorize them.
2. Prototype a slim dispatcher handling only workflow functions.
3. Measure performance against current implementation.
4. Outline migration steps and update documentation.
