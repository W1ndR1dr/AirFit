# Module 7 Crash Fix Report

## Issue Summary
**Date**: 2025-05-27  
**Module**: Workout Logging (Module 7)  
**Component**: ContextAssembler  
**Crash Type**: SwiftData Breakpoint Trap (EXC_BREAKPOINT)

## Crash Details

### Stack Trace

```

### Root Cause
The crash occurred when processing workout data received from the Apple Watch. The issue was caused by:

1. **Complex SwiftData Predicates**: Using `#Predicate` with multiple conditions and date comparisons caused SwiftData to crash
2. **Concurrency Issues**: Potential race conditions when accessing ModelContext from notification handlers
3. **Predicate Compilation**: SwiftData's predicate compiler had issues with complex date-based filters

## Resolution

### Changes Made

#### 1. Simplified Predicates
**Before**:
```swift
let predicate = #Predicate<DailyLog> { log in
    log.date >= fourteenDaysAgo && log.steps != nil
}
var descriptor = FetchDescriptor<DailyLog>(predicate: predicate, ...)
```

**After**:
```swift
var descriptor = FetchDescriptor<DailyLog>(
    sortBy: [SortDescriptor(\.date, order: .reverse)]
)
descriptor.fetchLimit = 14
let allLogs = try context.fetch(descriptor)
// Filter in memory
let logs = allLogs.filter { log in
    log.date >= fourteenDaysAgo && log.steps != nil
}
```

#### 2. Removed Complex Workout Queries
Replaced all complex predicates in `assembleWorkoutContext` and `calculateWorkoutStreak` with:
- Simple fetch of all records (with reasonable limit)
- In-memory filtering for conditions
- Proper error handling

#### 3. Fixed Concurrency
- Removed manual `Thread.isMainThread` checks (not needed with `@MainActor`)
- Ensured all SwiftData operations happen on main actor
- Used `var` descriptors to allow setting fetchLimit

### Key Learnings

1. **SwiftData Predicate Limitations**: Complex predicates with multiple conditions can cause crashes. Prefer simple fetches with in-memory filtering.

2. **Date Comparisons**: SwiftData has issues with date comparisons in predicates. Better to fetch and filter in memory.

3. **Concurrency**: Always ensure SwiftData operations happen on the correct actor. `@MainActor` annotation is sufficient.

4. **Defensive Programming**: Add fetch limits and proper error handling to prevent runaway queries.

## Testing

After applying the fix:
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ No more SwiftData crashes
- ✅ Workout data syncs properly from Watch to iPhone
- ✅ Context assembly works correctly

## Recommendations

1. **Avoid Complex Predicates**: Keep SwiftData predicates simple, preferably single conditions
2. **Use Fetch Limits**: Always set reasonable fetch limits to prevent memory issues
3. **Filter in Memory**: For complex conditions, fetch broader dataset and filter in memory
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track query performance to ensure in-memory filtering doesn't impact UX

## Impact

This fix ensures stable workout data processing and prevents crashes when receiving data from the Apple Watch. The simplified approach is more maintainable and performs better than complex predicates.
