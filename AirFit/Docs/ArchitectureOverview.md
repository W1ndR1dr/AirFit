Okay, this is a significant undertaking, and you're absolutely right to think about it in terms of a "recipe" for AI agents. Structuring this for AI-driven development requires extreme clarity, modularity, and an understanding of dependencies.

Given you don't code, I'll aim for a level of detail that is conceptually clear but also provides enough specificity that an AI code generation agent (like a sophisticated version of Codex) could interpret it. I'll also highlight parallel vs. sequential tasks.

**Important Caveats for AI Agent-Driven Development:**

*   **Agent Capabilities:** The success heavily relies on the capabilities of these AI agents. They need to understand context, maintain consistency across files, handle complex instructions, and ideally, be ableto test their own code.
*   **Human Oversight & Iteration:** Even with advanced AI, human oversight, review, and iterative refinement will be ESSENTIAL. You'll act as the "product owner" and "QA lead."
*   **Prompt Engineering for Agents:** Each task for an agent will require careful "prompt engineering" â€“ providing clear instructions, context, and expected outputs.
*   **State Management Between Agents/Tasks:** This is a huge challenge. How does Agent B know what Agent A did perfectly? This often requires a robust version control system (like Git) and potentially a shared understanding of the evolving codebase or very well-defined interfaces between modules.
*   **Code Style & Linting:** We can *specify* a code style, but enforcement will require tools (linters, formatters) that the agents (or a subsequent automated step) would use.

Let's structure this:

**I. AirFit App - Master Architecture Specification (v1.3)**

**Version:** 1.3
**Status:** Updated
**Last Updated:** December 2024
**Purpose:** This document defines the overall software architecture for the AirFit application. It outlines the major components, their responsibilities, interactions, and the foundational principles guiding development. This master document serves as the central reference for all modular sub-documents containing detailed tasks for AI development agents.

**1. Guiding Architectural Principles**

*   **Modularity & Separation of Concerns:** The system will be built as a collection of loosely coupled modules, each with a distinct responsibility. This facilitates parallel development, testability, and maintainability.
*   **Scalability & Maintainability:** Design choices should support future growth in features and user load without requiring major architectural overhauls. Clean code and clear interfaces are paramount.
*   **Testability:** All modules and components must be designed with testability in mind. Unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests will be integral to the development process.
*   **Platform Best Practices:** Adherence to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and platform-specific (iOS, WatchOS) best practices for Swift, SwiftUI, SwiftData, HealthKit, etc.
*   **Security & Privacy by Design:** Security and privacy considerations are embedded in the architecture from the ground up, not as an afterthought.
*   **Clarity for AI Agents:** All specifications must be explicit, unambiguous, and provide sufficient context for AI code generation agents.
*   **Chat-First Interface:** The primary user interaction paradigm is through natural language chat with the AI coach.
*   **Testing-First Development:** Module 0 establishes comprehensive testing patterns that all subsequent modules must follow.

**2. Technology Stack (Apple Ecosystem)**

*   **Programming Language:** Swift 6+ (latest stable version)
*   **UI Framework:** SwiftUI (for both iOS and WatchOS)
*   **Target Platforms:** iOS 18+, watchOS 11+
*   **Data Persistence:** SwiftData
*   **Health Data:** HealthKit, WorkoutKit
*   **Networking:** URLSession, Async/Await
*   **On-Device Transcription:** WhisperKit (for superior voice transcription accuracy)
*   **AI Model Interaction:** Multi-provider support via secure backend service
    *   Supported providers: OpenAI (GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), OpenRouter
    *   Primary recommendation: GPT-4 for complex interactions, Gemini 1.5 Flash for quick responses
*   **Version Control:** Git (essential for iterative development and agent collaboration)
*   **Dependency Management:** Swift Package Manager (SPM)
*   **Additional iOS 18 Features:** Live Activities, Enhanced Notifications, App Intents

**3. Overall System Architecture (Layered Approach)**

As defined in the Design Spec v1.2:

*   **Presentation Layer (SwiftUI):**
    *   Responsible for rendering all UI elements, capturing user input, and displaying data.
    *   Views will be lightweight and primarily driven by state from ViewModels or direct SwiftData queries.
    *   Chat interface serves as the primary interaction paradigm.
    *   **Code Style:** Follow Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines. Use clear, descriptive names for views, variables, and functions. Prefer composition over inheritance for views. Utilize previews extensively for UI development.
*   **Business Logic Layer (BLL):**
    *   Contains the core application logic, orchestrates data flow between the Presentation and Data/Service layers.
    *   Key Components: `CoachEngine`, `WorkoutGenerator`, `OnboardingManager`, `NutritionLogOrchestrator`, `ChatViewModel`, local parsers for simple commands.
    *   **Code Style:** Logic should be encapsulated in classes or structs with clear responsibilities. Use protocols to define contracts between components. Emphasize immutability where possible.
*   **Service Layer:**
    *   Manages all interactions with external systems and platform services.
    *   Key Components: `HealthKitManager`, `WeatherServiceAPIClient`, `AIServiceProtocol` (multi-provider), `VoiceInputManager` (WhisperKit), `NotificationManager`, `EngagementEngine`, `ExerciseDatabase`.
    *   **Exercise Database**: Offline-first exercise library powered by Free Exercise DB (Unlicense, 800+ exercises) with SwiftData storage, real-time search, and comprehensive categorization by muscle groups, equipment, and difficulty.
    *   **Code Style:** Each service should implement a clearly defined protocol. Handle errors gracefully using Swift's error handling mechanisms (try/catch, Result types). All network requests must be asynchronous.
*   **Data Layer (SwiftData):**
    *   The single source of truth for all persisted application data.
    *   Includes SwiftData Models (as defined in v1.1 and updated for Persona Blueprint Flow v3.1), and potentially manager classes for complex queries or data migrations if needed.
    *   **Code Style:** Model definitions should be clear and directly reflect the schema. Use `@Attribute` and `@Relationship` property wrappers as intended.

**4. Core Modules & Their Interactions (High-Level Overview)**

    8.  AI Provider -> `AIServiceProtocol` (response: text or function call)
    9.  `AIServiceProtocol` -> `CoachEngine` -> `ChatViewModel`
    10. If text: Stream to ChatView in real-time, Save `ChatMessage`
    11. If function call: Execute relevant function -> Update UI -> Save result

**6. Code Style and Conventions (To be enforced via SwiftLint/Format and Agent Instructions)**

*   **Language:** Swift 6+ (latest stable).
*   **Style Guide:** Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines. Additions:
    *   **Naming:** Descriptive (e.g., `UserProfileView`, `fetchWeatherData()`). PascalCase for types, camelCase for functions/variables.
    *   **Comments:** Explain *why*, not *what*, if code isn't self-explanatory. Use `MARK:` for organizing code.
    *   **Error Handling:** Prefer `Result` type for asynchronous operations that can fail. Use `do-catch` for throwing functions. Avoid force unwrapping (`!`) and force casting (`as!`).
    *   **Immutability:** Prefer `let` over `var`. Use immutable data structures where practical.
    *   **SwiftUI:** Create small, reusable views. Use `@State`, `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, `@EnvironmentObject`, `@Query` appropriately. Previews are mandatory for all views.
    *   **Concurrency:** Use `async/await` for asynchronous code. Use Actors for managing shared mutable state if necessary.
    *   **Testing:** Minimum 80% code coverage for business logic. All public methods must have tests.
*   **Project Structure:**
    *   Organize files by feature/module first, then by type (e.g., `AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Views/WelcomeView.swift`, `AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/ViewModels/OnboardingViewModel.swift`).
    *   Shared utilities in a `Shared` or `Common` group.
*   **Agent Instructions for Code Generation:**
    *   "Generate Swift code for a SwiftUI view named `[ViewName]` with the following elements and functionality..."
    *   "Implement a service class `[ServiceName]` conforming to `[ProtocolName]` with methods to..."
    *   "Write unit tests for `[ClassName.methodName]` covering the following scenarios..."
    *   "Ensure all generated code adheres to the project's SwiftLint configuration."
