# Phase 2 Test Migration Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Status**: Blocked by compilation errors

## Work Completed

### Phase 2 Prerequisites ‚úÖ
1. **Mock Audit**:
   - Found 40 mock files total
   - 21 implement MockProtocol pattern
   - 19 use different patterns (actors, simple mocks)
   - Fixed VoiceInputManager using real implementation instead of mock

2. **Mock Standardization**:
   - Added reset() methods to 8 critical mocks:
     - MockNotificationManager
     - MockWhisperServiceWrapper  
     - MockAVAudioRecorder
     - MockAVAudioSession
     - MockHealthKitPrefillProvider
     - MockWhisperKit
     - MockWhisperModelManager
     - MockAIGoalService
     - MockAIWorkoutService

3. **DI Registration Fixes**:
   - Updated DITestHelper to register dashboard services by protocol
   - Updated DIBootstrapper to register both concrete types and protocols
   - Fixed protocol/concrete type mismatch for HealthKitService (actor type)

### Dashboard Module Migration (In Progress) üöß
- DashboardViewModelTests already uses DI pattern
- Fixed service resolution to use protocols
- Cannot verify tests pass due to other compilation errors

## Blockers Found

### Test Files Disabled
1. **NetworkClientTests.swift** - Testing concrete NetworkClient instead of using mocks
2. **NetworkManagerTests.swift** - Testing singleton NetworkManager.shared
3. **NotificationManagerTests.swift** - Testing concrete NotificationManager

### Compilation Errors
Multiple test files have compilation errors preventing any tests from running:
- HealthKitManagerTests - MockHealthKitManager missing many expected methods
- HealthKitServiceTests - Missing types like SleepContext, HeartHealthContext
- PersonaGenerationTests - Fixed async/await issues
- Many more...

## Analysis

The test suite has accumulated significant technical debt:
1. **Mixed patterns**: Some tests use DI, others test concrete implementations
2. **Outdated mocks**: Mocks don't match current service interfaces
3. **Swift 6 issues**: Many async/await and actor isolation errors
4. **Missing types**: Tests reference types that may have been removed/renamed

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix HealthKitManagerTests first** - It's blocking many other tests
2. **Update MockHealthKitManager** - Add missing methods and properties
3. **Fix type references** - Find and update references to missing types

### Strategic Approach
1. **Focus on one module at a time** - Start with Dashboard since it's closest to working
2. **Update mocks incrementally** - Fix mocks as needed for each module
3. **Consider test reset** - Some modules might be easier to rewrite than fix

### Alternative Approach
Given the extensive issues, consider:
1. **Minimal viable test suite** - Get a few key tests passing first
2. **Progressive enhancement** - Add tests module by module
3. **Parallel test rewrite** - Create new test files alongside old ones

## Next Steps

1. Fix MockHealthKitManager to match current HealthKitManager interface
2. Resolve missing type references (SleepContext, etc.)
3. Get DashboardViewModelTests passing
4. Continue with other Dashboard module tests
5. Move to next module once Dashboard is stable
