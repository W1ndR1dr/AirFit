# Onboarding Enhancement Progress

**Started**: 2025-01-17
**Branch**: Codex1
**Status**: In Progress

## 🔄 Current State Summary

### What Was Done (Session 1)
1. **Fixed Critical Crash** ✅
   - Issue: DI container wasn't recreated after API key setup
   - Solution: Implemented proper container recreation in ContentView
   - Added demo mode option to bypass API setup
   - Files modified:
     - `AirFit/Application/ContentView.swift`
     - `AirFit/Core/DI/DIBootstrapper.swift`
     - `AirFit/Core/Utilities/AppConstants.swift`
     - `AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Views/InitialAPISetupView.swift`
     - `AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Views/OnboardingFlowViewDI.swift`

2. **Architecture Analysis** ✅
   - Identified dual onboarding paradigm (legacy vs conversational)
   - Found conversational flow is mostly placeholder
   - Confirmed UI components are excellent and reusable
   - Services and models are well-structured

3. **UI Standards Review** ✅
   - Current: GlassCard with 12pt blur, pastel gradients
   - Future: Text on gradients, GlassSheet with 4pt blur
   - Animation: CascadeText, physics-based springs
   - Spacing: AppSpacing tokens (xs: 12pt to xl: 48pt)

### What Was Done (Session 2)
1. **Fixed Build Errors** ✅
   - Removed 8 orphaned old onboarding view files (CoreAspirationView, LifeSnapshotView, etc.)
   - Fixed DIBootstrapper OnboardingService initialization (resolved llmOrchestrator)
   - Fixed ErrorPresentationView switch exhaustiveness (added .llm and .authentication cases)
   - **Result**: Build succeeds with 0 errors (only deprecation warnings remain)

### What Was Done (Session 3)
1. **Simplified Onboarding Architecture** ✅
   - Removed legacy/conversational mode switching from OpeningScreenView
   - Rewrote OnboardingViewModel as single clean flow
   - Added new screen states: opening → healthKit → lifeContext → goals → communicationStyle → synthesis → coachReady
   - Files modified:
     - `AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Views/OpeningScreenView.swift`
     - `AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/ViewModels/OnboardingViewModel.swift`
     - `AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Models/OnboardingModels.swift`
     - `AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Services/OnboardingService.swift`
     - `AirFit/Core/Protocols/OnboardingServiceProtocol.swift`
     - `AirFit/Core/DI/DIBootstrapper.swift`

2. **Added Goal Synthesis Types** ✅
   - Created OnboardingRawData structure for LLM input
   - Created LLMGoalSynthesis structure for LLM output
   - Added CommunicationStyle and InformationStyle enums
   - Implemented synthesizeGoals method in OnboardingService

3. **UI Updates** ✅
   - Updated OpeningScreenView with o3-inspired design (text on gradients)
   - Added CascadeText for welcome animation
   - Simplified to single "Let's begin" button
   - Removed GlassCard usage per future design direction

4. **Gradient Evolution Implementation** ✅
   - Created OnboardingContainerView to manage flow and transitions
   - Implemented gradient mapping for each screen
   - Added ChapterTransition modifier (0.55s transitions)
   - Gradient advances on forward navigation only

5. **HealthKit Authorization Screen** ✅
   - Implemented enhanced design with text on gradients
   - Added data preview when authorized
   - Smart button states based on authorization status
   - Minimal use of material backgrounds (only for data preview)

### Key Decisions Made
- Remove dual-mode confusion, commit to single clean flow
- Use o3-inspired UI patterns from day one (text directly on gradients)
- Implement progressive disclosure for goals
- Add mix-and-match communication preferences (checkboxes not radio buttons)
- Create LLM synthesis with structured JSON output
- Move away from OnboardingFlowCoordinator to simpler OnboardingViewModel approach

## 📋 Implementation Plan

- [ ] Edge case handling and error recovery

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
API Key Setup (pre-onboarding) → Opening → HealthKit → 
Life Context → Goals → Communication → LLM Synthesis → Coach Ready
```

### Key Components
- `OnboardingFlowCoordinator` - Single flow controller
- `OnboardingViewModel` - Simplified state management
- `GoalSynthesisService` - LLM goal analysis
- `PersonaSynthesizer` - Coach generation (existing)

### UI Patterns
- BaseScreen with gradient backgrounds
- CascadeText for headings
- Text directly on gradients (no cards)
- 0.55s transitions between screens
- Gradient evolution on navigation

## 🐛 Known Issues
1. Voice input currently stubbed with WhisperStubs
2. Conversational UI shows placeholder text
3. Goal models support multi-goal but UI doesn't
4. Some SwiftLint violations in existing code

## 📝 Next Immediate Tasks
1. Clean up onboarding architecture
2. Implement opening screen with o3 patterns
3. Create HealthKit authorization with data preview
4. Build conversational life context screen

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
API Key Setup (pre-onboarding) → Opening → HealthKit → 
Life Context → Goals → Communication → LLM Synthesis → Coach Ready
```

### Key Components
- **OnboardingContainerView** - Main container managing flow and gradient transitions
- **OnboardingViewModel** - Simplified state management (no dual modes)

2. Review ONBOARDING_ENHANCEMENT.md for design details
3. Check git log for recent changes: `git log --oneline -10`
4. Continue with pending screens in order:
   - LifeContextView (with voice input)
   - GoalsProgressiveView (multi-goal system)
   - CommunicationStyleView (checkboxes not radio)
   - LLMSynthesisView (processing animation)

### Code Patterns to Follow:
```swift
// Screen structure
BaseScreen {
    VStack {
        // Back button
        // Spacer
        // Main content with CascadeText
        // Spacer
        // Action buttons
    }
}

// Animations
.opacity(animateIn ? 1 : 0)
.scaleEffect(animateIn ? 1 : 0.5)
.animation(.spring(response: 0.6, dampingFraction: 0.7), value: animateIn)

// Gradient usage
.foregroundStyle(gradientManager.currentGradient(for: colorScheme))
```
