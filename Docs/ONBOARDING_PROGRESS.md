# Onboarding Enhancement Progress

**Started**: 2025-01-17
**Branch**: Codex1
**Status**: In Progress

## 🔄 Current State Summary

### What Was Done
1. **Fixed Critical Crash** ✅
   - Issue: DI container wasn't recreated after API key setup
   - Solution: Implemented proper container recreation in ContentView
   - Added demo mode option to bypass API setup
   - Files modified:
     - `AirFit/Application/ContentView.swift`
     - `AirFit/Core/DI/DIBootstrapper.swift`
     - `AirFit/Core/Utilities/AppConstants.swift`
     - `AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Views/InitialAPISetupView.swift`
     - `AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Views/OnboardingFlowViewDI.swift`

2. **Architecture Analysis** ✅
   - Identified dual onboarding paradigm (legacy vs conversational)
   - Found conversational flow is mostly placeholder
   - Confirmed UI components are excellent and reusable
   - Services and models are well-structured

3. **UI Standards Review** ✅
   - Current: GlassCard with 12pt blur, pastel gradients
   - Future: Text on gradients, GlassSheet with 4pt blur
   - Animation: CascadeText, physics-based springs
   - Spacing: AppSpacing tokens (xs: 12pt to xl: 48pt)

### Key Decisions Made
- Remove dual-mode confusion, commit to conversational approach
- Use o3-inspired UI patterns from day one
- Implement progressive disclosure for goals
- Add mix-and-match communication preferences
- Create LLM synthesis with structured JSON output

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Priority: High)
- [ ] Clean up onboarding architecture - remove legacy/conversational switching
- [ ] Implement single conversational flow coordinator
- [ ] Set up gradient evolution system for screen transitions
- [ ] Create onboarding state machine with proper error boundaries

### Phase 2: Screen Implementation (Priority: High)
Following exact flow from ONBOARDING_ENHANCEMENT.md:

1. **Opening Screen** (Text-forward, gradient background)
   - [ ] CascadeText animation for "Welcome to AirFit"
   - [ ] Single "Let's begin" button
   - [ ] Gradient: peachRose

2. **HealthKit Authorization** (Smart data prefilling)
   - [ ] "Now, let's sync your health data" with explanation
   - [ ] Request essential permissions only
   - [ ] Show actual data found or graceful "no data" message
   - [ ] Gradient advance to oceanBreeze

3. **Life Context** (Conversational collection)
   - [ ] "Tell me about your daily life" with large text area
   - [ ] Voice input option with real transcription
   - [ ] Smart prompting based on HealthKit data
   - [ ] Gradient advance to lavenderDream

4. **Goals Progressive** (Free text → structured)
   - [ ] "What would you like to achieve?" free text input
   - [ ] LLM parsing with structured suggestions
   - [ ] Multi-select checkboxes for additional goals
   - [ ] Gradient advance to mintBreeze

5. **Communication Style** (Mix & match)
   - [ ] "How do you like to be coached?" with multiple options
   - [ ] Checkboxes not radio buttons
   - [ ] Smart defaults based on goals
   - [ ] Gradient advance to sunsetGlow

6. **LLM Synthesis** (Visible magic)
   - [ ] "Creating your personalized coach..." with progress
   - [ ] Animated processing steps
   - [ ] Gradient cycling effect
   - [ ] Error recovery if synthesis fails

7. **Coach Ready** (Success state)
   - [ ] "Your AI coach is ready" with summary
   - [ ] Generated coach description
   - [ ] Two buttons: start or learn more
   - [ ] Gradient settles on user's home color

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (Priority: High)
- [ ] Create GoalSynthesisService with structured JSON output
- [ ] Implement LLM prompts for goal analysis
- [ ] Add fallback templates for offline/error cases
- [ ] Connect to PersonaEngine for coach generation

### Phase 4: Polish & Excellence (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Rewrite all prompts with conversational tone
- [ ] Add haptic feedback throughout
- [ ] Implement accessibility features
- [ ] Performance optimization (<3s for all operations)
- [ ] Edge case handling and error recovery

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
API Key Setup (pre-onboarding) → Opening → HealthKit → 
Life Context → Goals → Communication → LLM Synthesis → Coach Ready
```

### Key Components
- `OnboardingFlowCoordinator` - Single flow controller
- `OnboardingViewModel` - Simplified state management
- `GoalSynthesisService` - LLM goal analysis
- `PersonaSynthesizer` - Coach generation (existing)

### UI Patterns
- BaseScreen with gradient backgrounds
- CascadeText for headings
- Text directly on gradients (no cards)
- 0.55s transitions between screens
- Gradient evolution on navigation

## 🐛 Known Issues
1. Voice input currently stubbed with WhisperStubs
2. Conversational UI shows placeholder text
3. Goal models support multi-goal but UI doesn't
4. Some SwiftLint violations in existing code

## 📝 Next Immediate Tasks
1. Clean up onboarding architecture
2. Implement opening screen with o3 patterns
3. Create HealthKit authorization with data preview
4. Build conversational life context screen

## 💡 Implementation Notes
- Always run `xcodegen generate && swiftlint --strict` after changes
- Target 0 errors, 0 warnings for all builds
- Use atomic commits with clear messages
- Test on iPhone 16 Pro simulator with iOS 18.4
- Maintain <6 minute total onboarding time
