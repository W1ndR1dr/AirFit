Integrating OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, and OpenRouter APIs in Swift (iOS/macOS)

Integrating large language model APIs into Swift apps involves calling REST endpoints with proper authentication, constructing JSON requests, handling streaming responses, and following best practices for reliability and security. This guide covers how to embed OpenAI, Google Gemini (Vertex AI), Anthropic (Claude), and OpenRouter APIs into iOS/macOS apps using Swift. We’ll cover authentication, request/response patterns (including chat, completion, and image generation), streaming support, error handling, rate limiting, caching, example usage, agent-like workflows, and platform-specific considerations. Code snippets and patterns are included to illustrate implementation, with emphasis on correctness, security, performance, and maintainability.

OpenAI API Integration (Swift for iOS/macOS)

OpenAI’s API (e.g. ChatGPT models, DALL·E image generation) is accessed via HTTPS calls. In Swift, you can use URLSession or community SDKs to communicate with OpenAI’s endpoints. Below we break down key integration steps and practices.

Authentication & Configuration

OpenAI uses API keys for authentication. You must obtain a secret API key from your OpenAI account and include it in an HTTP Authorization header for every request (no user login flow is needed). Specifically, add:

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

in the request headers ￼. This can be set on a URLRequest in Swift as request.setValue("Bearer \(apiKey)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization"). Keep the API key out of source code – load it from a secure source at runtime. OpenAI strongly recommends not exposing API keys in client apps; in production, calls should be proxied through your own backend to protect the key ￼ ￼. If a backend is not feasible, consider requiring users to provide their own API key or storing the key in the iOS Keychain (never in plaintext in the app bundle).

For configuration, OpenAI’s base URL is https://api.openai.com/v1/. You’ll typically also set a timeout on requests (e.g. 60s) and possibly an organization ID header if applicable (OpenAI allows an OpenAI-Organization header, but it’s optional). No other special config is needed on the client side beyond the API key.

Sending Requests (Chat, Completions, and Image Generation)

Chat and Text Completion Requests: To request a text completion or chat response, you send a JSON payload via POST to an endpoint like /v1/completions (for older GPT-3 style completions) or /v1/chat/completions (for ChatGPT models like GPT-3.5/4). The content-type must be JSON. For chat models, the JSON should include the model name and an array of message objects (with roles like "user", "assistant", and optionally "system" for context). For example, a chat request body might look like:

{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how can I integrate OpenAI into Swift?"}
  ],
  "max_tokens": 500,
  "stream": false
}

In Swift, you can create a struct for this payload or construct a dictionary and serialize to JSON with JSONEncoder/JSONSerialization. Then use URLSession.shared.data(for: request) with a POST request. The response will be JSON containing the completion. You can decode it into model structs using Codable. For instance, OpenAI’s response JSON for chat includes an array choices where each choice has a message with role and content.

Image Generation Requests: OpenAI provides an image generation API (DALL·E) via the endpoint POST /v1/images/generations. To use it, include your API key in the header and send a JSON payload with at least a prompt string (and optionally parameters like number of images and size) ￼ ￼. For example:

{
  "prompt": "A surreal painting of a futuristic cityscape.",
  "n": 1,
  "size": "1024x1024"
}

The response will contain image URLs or base64 data for the generated images ￼. In Swift, you handle this similar to text: make a POST request with JSON and parse the response. Be mindful that image generation responses might take a few seconds; perform the request off the main thread and update the UI once you have the image URL or data (you can then load the image asynchronously).

Using Swift Tools: You can use the built-in URLSession for networking. For example, using Swift concurrency:

var request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions")!)
request.httpMethod = "POST"
request.setValue("Bearer \(openAIKey)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
request.httpBody = try JSONEncoder().encode(myChatRequestPayload)

let (data, response) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
// Then decode `data` from JSON into a response model

Alternatively, you can use third-party HTTP libraries like Alamofire or community SDKs. There are open-source Swift packages (e.g. OpenAI Swift SDK by MacPaw or others) that wrap these calls. For instance, one community SDK allows configuration and then calling openAI.chats.create(...) or similar high-level functions ￼ ￼. These can simplify integration, but using plain URLSession as above gives you full control.

Streaming Support (Server-Sent Events)

OpenAI’s chat completions support streaming responses, which allows your app to receive the answer incrementally (token by token) for a better UX. To enable this, include "stream": true in your request JSON. The API will then send a stream of SSE (Server-Sent Events) over the HTTP response. Each chunk of data will be prefixed with data:  and contain a JSON fragment (or “[DONE]” when complete) ￼.

Implementing streaming in Swift requires handling a streaming HTTP response. With URLSession, you can use a URLSessionDataDelegate to receive data as it arrives. For example, create a URLSession with a delegate that implements urlSession(_:dataTask:didReceive:). When you get data, append it to a buffer and parse for completed JSON segments or newline-delimited SSE events. Each event will contain a partial message. OpenAI’s events don’t use explicit event: names (only data: lines), so you can ignore any prefix like data:  and then decode the JSON. A chunk typically looks like {"id":"chatcmpl-...","choices":[{"delta":{"content":"Hello"}}], ...} for a piece of text.

Swift Concurrency approach: In Swift 5.9+, you can use URLSession.bytes(for: request) to get an AsyncBytes sequence. You can then iterate over it and accumulate text. Another approach is using an SSE client library (there are a few for Swift) ￼ ￼. For example, the community SSE libraries or Combine’s URLSession.DataTaskPublisher can be adapted to buffer partial data. Some Swift OpenAI libraries already implement streaming: e.g. the MacPaw OpenAI SDK provides openAI.chatsStream(query:) which delivers tokens one-by-one via a closure or AsyncThrowingStream ￼ ￼. Under the hood, it uses the SSE stream from OpenAI. You can model your implementation similarly.

When streaming, update your UI (e.g. a TextView or UILabel) incrementally on the main thread as new tokens arrive. Ensure you handle the end-of-stream signal (“[DONE]”) to know when to stop.

Error Handling, Rate Limiting, and Usage Constraints

Robust error handling is crucial. The OpenAI API can return various HTTP errors: 400 for bad requests (e.g. invalid JSON or parameters), 401/403 for authentication issues, 429 for rate limits, 500/502 for server errors, etc. The response usually contains a JSON with an "error" object that includes a message and code. Parse error responses and surface useful info to the user (or to developers). For instance, if you get a 401, verify that the API key is correct and not expired. If 429 Too Many Requests occurs, you should implement retry logic with backoff ￼ ￼. The OpenAI Cookbook suggests tips like spacing out requests, queuing them, and gradually increasing throughput ￼.

Rate limiting: OpenAI applies per-minute request and token limits (which scale with paid usage). If you hit a 429 error, examine the response headers (e.g. Retry-After if provided) or error message (which may indicate your quota limit and when to retry). Implement a simple exponential backoff: wait a few seconds and retry the request, or accumulate requests and spread them out. Avoid tight loops of immediate retries, as that can exacerbate the issue ￼ ￼. Also consider monitoring your app’s usage: OpenAI provides a usage dashboard, and the API responses include usage fields (token counts) that you can sum to track cost.

Error handling patterns in Swift: Use do-catch around URLSession calls to catch network or parsing errors. For HTTP errors, check the HTTPURLResponse.statusCode. You might create a Swift enum for APIError (with cases like .rateLimit, .unauthorized, .serverError(message: String), etc.) to better manage them. In asynchronous UI flows (SwiftUI), ensure you update the UI (e.g. show an alert) on the main thread when an error occurs.

Usage constraints: The OpenAI models have context length limits (e.g. ~4K tokens for GPT-3.5, ~8K or more for GPT-4). If your prompt + expected answer exceed this, the API will error. It’s good to truncate or summarize context on the client side if needed. Also, OpenAI’s policies must be followed: you should not use the API for disallowed content, and ideally you should implement content filtering (OpenAI offers a moderation API to check prompts/answers). If your app allows arbitrary user input to the model, consider running OpenAI’s moderation endpoint on user prompts or model outputs to catch harmful content before display.

Token Cost Estimation and Model Usage

Costs are based on tokens. While the API returns usage, you might want to estimate tokens beforehand to decide which model to use or to warn about cost. Tokenization is complex (uses Byte-Pair Encoding). In Swift, you could use a third-party token counter (if available) or approximate by character length (not very accurate). A better approach is to rely on the API’s response usage metrics. For example, the response JSON for a completion includes something like:

"usage": {
  "prompt_tokens": 50,
  "completion_tokens": 150,
  "total_tokens": 200
}

You can accumulate total_tokens to monitor usage in the app and perhaps show the user their token consumption (especially if they use their own key). For cost estimation, multiply tokens by the model’s price per 1K tokens (from OpenAI’s pricing page) to get dollar cost.

Different models have different pricing and capabilities. As of 2025, GPT-3.5 is cheaper and faster, GPT-4 is more capable but costlier and slower. You might allow the user to choose, or dynamically select (e.g. use GPT-3.5 for quick, small queries and GPT-4 for complex ones). If using function calling or other advanced features, note which models support them (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 turbo do support function calling). Always specify the model name in your requests; do not rely on a default.

Prompt/Response Caching Strategies

To reduce latency and cost, implement caching of prompts and responses. Caching is especially useful if your app might send the same prompt repeatedly (for example, common questions or if a user repeats a query due to network issues). A simple strategy is to use an in-memory cache (e.g. an NSCache or Dictionary) mapping prompt -> answer. For longer-term caching (between app launches or for offline use), you can persist results to disk (e.g. in a file or Core Data). Make sure to respect user privacy if caching sensitive content.

Cache design: You might hash the prompt (or a normalized version of it) to use as a key for stored responses. When a request comes in, check the cache first. If a cached result exists (and perhaps is recent enough), you can return it immediately instead of calling the API. Otherwise, call the API and then store the result.

Be careful with cache invalidation: if your prompts include dynamic data or conversation context, the same prompt string might not always be safe to reuse a cached answer. Cache mostly for truly identical standalone queries. Another strategy is caching at a higher level – e.g., caching the last N Q&A pairs to allow the user to scroll up to recent answers without refetching, or caching results of expensive operations (like an LLM analysis on a fixed document).

Also consider using the model’s response to help cache partial work. For instance, if building an agent that goes step by step, you might memoize intermediate steps. If using a vector database or embedding-based search in your app, you could cache embeddings or retrieval results similarly.

OpenAI does not provide a built-in cache, but OpenRouter (discussed later) has an optional prompt caching mechanism on their side ￼ ￼. For pure client-side caching, you control it yourself.

Real-World Swift Usage Example

Many developers have integrated OpenAI into Swift apps. For example, the open-source MacPaw OpenAI Swift SDK provides a high-level interface. Using that library, one can simply do OpenAI.configure(apiKey: "...") once (e.g. in AppDelegate) ￼, then call methods like OpenAI.shared.completions.create(prompt: ...) to get a completion ￼. The SDK internally handles building the URLRequest and decoding the JSON. It even supports streaming via callbacks or Combine publishers ￼ ￼. This illustrates how you might structure your own integration: a singleton service class that wraps all OpenAI HTTP calls, exposing Swift-friendly methods.

Another example is a SwiftUI app tutorial (e.g. on AppCoda or Medium) that demonstrates calling ChatGPT from an iOS app. Typically, they show creating a view model that holds the conversation, and using async/await to call the API when the user sends a message. The response is then appended to a list of messages in the UI on the main thread. Error states (like no API key or failed request) are handled by showing alerts.

If looking for community examples updated in 2025, you can find open-source projects such as LLMConnect (an iOS client that supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter) ￼. Those projects often show how to manage multiple API integrations and switching between them. Studying such code can reveal best practices in architecting the networking layer (like abstracting a protocol for “LLMService” that different API clients conform to).

Architectural Considerations for Agent/Code-Generation Workflows

If you plan more advanced agent-based interactions (e.g. code generation assistants or multi-step reasoning), design your Swift app to manage the dialogue state and tool use. OpenAI’s functions feature allows the model to request your app to call a function (like run code, fetch info, etc.). In a Swift app, you can define functions (like a calculator, a web search action, etc.) and pass their schemas to the model in the prompt. When the model responds with a function call (captured in the JSON response), your app should intercept it, execute the function (in Swift), then send the function’s output back to the model in a follow-up request. This turns your app + model into an “agent” loop. Architecturally, you might implement this as a loop in your view model or a dedicated controller: while the model output contains a function call, handle it and continue the conversation. Ensure this loop can be cancelled if needed (to avoid infinite cycles).

For code generation specifically (like integrating an AI coding assistant), you might use the model to produce code, then actually compile or run that code on-device (if safe) or in a sandbox, and feed errors back to the model. This requires careful sandboxing (especially on iOS, where running arbitrary code is non-trivial). More commonly, you’d use the model’s output to assist the developer (display the code with syntax highlighting, allow editing). The agent aspect might be the model suggesting changes and the user approving/running them.

Another consideration is context management: in a multi-turn conversation or agent loop, you need to keep track of prior messages or state. Typically, you accumulate a messages array (trimming earlier ones if you approach token limits). Ensure that this array is stored either in memory or persisted if the conversation should survive app restarts. Some developers integrate a vector database to store conversation snippets or use the new Model Context Protocol (MCP) if on Apple platforms supporting it (MCP is an emerging approach to unify context for models). For instance, Anthropic and others have been exploring standardized context interfaces (Apple’s MCP concept) ￼, but this is optional.

iOS/macOS Platform-Specific Notes (OpenAI)

Networking: Apple requires usage of secure connections (HTTPS) by default (App Transport Security). OpenAI’s endpoints are HTTPS so that’s fine. If you use URLSession, it works out of the box. Just be aware of backgrounding – if a request is in progress and the app goes to background (especially if you allow long-running streams), consider using a URLSessionConfiguration.background or handling Task cancellation appropriately.

Secure Key Storage: As noted, never hardcode API keys in the app binary. If the app is for personal use, you might store it in user defaults or Keychain after prompting the user. For broader distribution, a common pattern is to have your own server as a middleman (which holds the key and maybe applies additional rate limiting or logging). That avoids placing secret keys on devices. If that’s not possible, at least obscure the key (though any determined attacker could extract it). Using the iOS Keychain API to store the key which is loaded at runtime is somewhat safer than plaintext in code.

App Store Guidelines: Apple treats AI-generated content similarly to user-generated content for review purposes. If your app can display potentially objectionable content from the model, you must implement content filtering or age-restrict the app ￼. In practice, this means either set your App Store age rating to 17+ or use filters to prevent disallowed content from showing to users. OpenAI’s own content moderation API can help filter violence, hate, sexual content, etc. You would call the moderation endpoint with the model’s output before showing it, and handle flags (e.g. refuse or edit the response). If you don’t filter, be prepared to justify the 17+ rating. Additionally, Apple requires that apps with user-generated content (which by extension includes AI content) have a mechanism to report/block content and a privacy policy. Make sure to provide a way for users to report problematic AI outputs and be responsive in removing or correcting them if your app stores or displays those outputs in a community setting ￼ ￼.

Performance: On-device, the networking and JSON parsing are usually the bottlenecks (along with the model’s own latency). Use async/await to keep UI responsive, and consider showing a typing indicator while waiting for the AI. For streaming, flush tokens to the UI smoothly (debounce if needed to avoid too frequent UI updates). Memory-wise, store only what you need (long chats can accumulate large strings; consider truncating history).

In summary, integrating OpenAI in Swift involves straightforward REST calls with proper headers, handling JSON responses or SSE streams, and diligent error/edge-case handling. Next, we’ll see how Google’s Gemini (Vertex AI) integration differs, followed by Anthropic and OpenRouter.

Google Gemini API Integration (Swift for iOS/macOS)

Google’s Gemini (part of Google’s generative AI offering) can be accessed via Google Cloud’s Vertex AI API. In late 2024/2025, Google introduced easier client integration via Firebase’s AI offerings. We’ll cover how to authenticate and use Gemini in Swift, including the new Firebase AI Logic SDK approach and direct Vertex API calls, plus special features like multimodal support and streaming.

Authentication & Setup (Google Cloud vs Firebase)

There are two primary ways to call Gemini models from an iOS app:
	•	Vertex AI REST API (Google Cloud) – Traditional approach where you call Google’s endpoints with OAuth2 authentication or API keys.
	•	Firebase AI Logic SDK (Gemini in Firebase) – A newer, mobile-friendly SDK (formerly called “Vertex AI in Firebase”, now Firebase AI Logic as of May 2025 ￼) that simplifies auth and integration for client apps.

Firebase AI Logic (Recommended for mobile): This approach allows you to use Google’s Swift SDK to call Gemini with minimal credentials. You need to have a Firebase project and enable the Generative AI features. In your Firebase console, add Firebase AI Logic to your app and choose a provider. You’ll be given an option for Gemini Developer API (no billing required for testing) or Vertex AI Gemini API (requires billing) ￼ ￼. If you select Gemini Developer API, Firebase will generate an API key in your project (for calling a limited version of Gemini). However, Google advises not to embed this key in your app code ￼ ￼. Instead, the Firebase AI SDK handles authentication under the hood once configured. Essentially, you’ll download a GoogleService-Info.plist for your Firebase app as usual, and initialize Firebase in your app.

After setting up Firebase (via FirebaseApp.configure() in AppDelegate), you can initialize the AI service. For example, using the Firebase AI Logic Swift SDK, you might do:

import FirebaseAI // part of Firebase SDK
...
// Initialize the Gemini backend service
let ai = FirebaseAI.firebaseAI(backend: .googleAI())

￼ ￼. This code indicates the SDK is connecting to Google’s AI backend. Under the hood, it uses the API key stored in your Firebase project config (not exposed in code) and authenticates requests for you.

If you go the Vertex AI direct route, you’d need to obtain OAuth credentials. Typically that means using a service account key (JSON) and implementing the OAuth flow in-app (which is not ideal on mobile), or delegating calls to a secure server. Because of these complexities, the Firebase client SDK route is much more straightforward for iOS.

Structuring Requests (Chat, Completion, and Multimodal prompts)

Whether you use FirebaseAI SDK or direct REST, you will create requests in a similar structure as OpenAI’s, but with Google’s specifics. In Vertex AI’s PaLM API (which Gemini extends), a chat request includes an array of messages and parameters like temperature, etc. The model names might be like "models/chat-bison-001" for PaLM or specific Gemini model names (Gemini models had versions like “Gemini 1.5” etc., possibly identified by ID in the API). If using the FirebaseAI SDK, it likely abstracts the model selection after you connect your Firebase project to a specific model.

Using FirebaseAI SDK: You would first get a GenerativeModel instance from the AI service, then call methods on it. For example, there might be a function to get a text completion given a prompt. The exact API is something like:

let model = try await ai.getGenerativeModel(name: "models/chat-gemini-002") 
let response = try await model.generateText(with: "Hello, how are you?")

(This is a pseudo-code guess – the actual SDK might differ, but conceptually it wraps the REST call). The Firebase AI Logic documentation provides guides and even a sample app ￼ ￼. The sample app shows how to integrate the SDK and make calls.

If using REST API directly, you’d call Vertex endpoints such as POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta2/models/MODEL_NAME:generateMessage (for chat) or :generateText (for single-turn). You must include an Authorization header with a Bearer token (OAuth 2 access token obtained via Google’s libraries or a service account). This is complex to do purely client-side without exposing credentials, hence again why Firebase or a backend is advised.

Multimodal (Images, etc.): Gemini is multimodal – it can accept images, and Google’s API also offers an image generation model called Imagen. With FirebaseAI SDK, you can also access Imagen models similarly ￼. The Firebase console allows adding the Imagen model as a provider as well ￼. If you want to send an image to Gemini (e.g. ask a question about an image), the API supports that via a multipart request or by providing a Google Cloud Storage URL of the image. The Firebase SDK likely has methods for that. For example, you might convert a UIImage to Data and then call something like model.generateText(with: .image(someImageData), prompt: "Describe this image"). Check Google’s docs for the exact method – this is an advanced use case.

Streaming and the Gemini Live API

Google’s Gemini API supports streaming outputs and even bidirectional streaming for live interactions. In fact, Google has a Gemini Live API which allows continuous send/receive (useful for voice assistants, etc.) ￼ ￼.

If using the REST interface, you can request streaming responses: Vertex AI’s API might not use SSE in the same way as OpenAI/Anthropic, especially if you’re using gRPC. However, Google’s docs indicate the Gemini API can stream responses for faster token-by-token output ￼. With the Firebase SDK, it’s possible they provide publishers or async sequences for the streaming tokens. For instance, the Swift SDK might use Combine or Swift AsyncStream. A snippet from Firebase AI Logic docs for Android shows adding a dependency on Reactive Streams for streaming ￼, suggesting the iOS SDK might have something analogous (perhaps using Combine).

If bidirectional streaming is needed (e.g. voice input streaming to the model while receiving output), that likely requires gRPC or WebSockets. It’s an advanced scenario where you continuously feed audio frames and get text back (like a real-time transcription or assistant). The Firebase AI documentation references a Live API for streaming input/output including audio ￼. That might not yet be directly available in the Swift SDK (possibly it’s in preview). If it is, you would use it if building something like a voice assistant that listens and responds simultaneously.

For typical chat UIs, one-way streaming (model streaming its answer) is sufficient and provides a good experience. Implement it similar to OpenAI’s SSE: the Firebase SDK probably hides the SSE and just gives you callbacks. If you call the REST API directly and it uses SSE, handle it as described earlier (with URLSession). If it uses HTTP chunking without SSE framing, handle accordingly. Always refer to Google’s latest SDK docs – by May 2025, they emphasized using the unified Firebase SDK over the older standalone library ￼ ￼ (the old generative-ai-swift SDK was deprecated for the Firebase approach ￼).

Error Handling, Quotas, and Rate Limits

Google’s Vertex AI has its own quota system. Errors will come as standard Google Cloud errors in JSON (with an "error": { "code": ..., "message": ...} structure). Handle HTTP status codes like 400, 401, 403 (for permission issues – e.g. if the Cloud project isn’t set up correctly you might get a 403), and 429 or 500 if too many requests or server issues. The Firebase AI Logic SDK might throw Swift Errors or provide a result type.

Be mindful of quotas: Google’s free quotas for generative models (especially the Developer API in Spark plan) might be limited in QPS or daily tokens. The error message will indicate if you exceed them. Implement backoff and perhaps show a message like “The service is busy, please try again.”

Token costs: Gemini models (especially larger ones) will have pricing similar to PaLM API. Track usage if possible. Google Cloud’s client libraries don’t automatically give usage info like OpenAI does, so you may rely on Cloud console metrics. If using Developer API (no-cost in testing), you might run into limits rather than costs. For production on Blaze plan, ensure you handle billing errors or quota exhausted errors gracefully (e.g. inform the user the service is unavailable).

Caching Strategies for Gemini API

Similar caching approaches apply as with OpenAI. If your app uses the same prompts on Gemini repeatedly, cache them. However, note that model outputs may differ between models (Gemini vs OpenAI) even for same input, so cache per-model if you use multiple. Also, Google’s terms might not allow indefinite caching of certain content – but generally caching AI outputs locally for user experience should be fine.

If using Firebase SDK, you might not have low-level access to things like ETag for caching. Instead, implement your own in-memory/disk caching for the content. For images generated by Imagen model, consider caching those images on disk to avoid regenerating (maybe treat it like any remote image caching). For text, the volume is smaller, so an SQLite or CoreData store of past questions and answers could serve as a cache/history.

One unique angle: since Google’s model is on their cloud, you can also use Vertex AI’s server-side features to optimize calls. For example, Vertex AI has a concept of tuned models or stored prompt templates. But those are more server-side; on the client, caching remains a manual task.

Real-World Swift Usage Example

A number of blog posts and tutorials surfaced around late 2024 when Google launched the PaLM API and later Gemini. For instance, AppCoda published a tutorial on integrating Google Bard/Gemini in a SwiftUI app ￼. They showed how to call a REST endpoint with URLSession. More recently, with the Firebase integration GA, Google engineers have demoed using the Swift SDK (there are talks from Google I/O 2025 showcasing mobile generative AI). An example from a Google Engineer on YouTube demonstrates securing API keys and integrating Gemini with SwiftUI ￼. The Firebase sample quickstart (linked in Google’s docs) is a great reference – it’s a full Xcode project on GitHub that illustrates prompts, responses, and even some multimodal use-cases ￼ ￼.

If looking for updated community projects: the GitHub repo jakirseu/Gemini-AI-iOS-SwiftUI provides a chat app template for Gemini ￼. It likely uses the older SDK or direct API, but might be updated to the Firebase SDK. Studying its code can show how to handle the JSON, update UI, etc., specifically for Google’s responses.

Agent and Workflow Considerations for Gemini

Google’s models also support function calling (sometimes termed “tools” in their docs). Gemini 2, for example, is expected to have advanced reasoning and tool use. If Google’s API supports something akin to OpenAI’s function call, you could incorporate similar agent loops. Additionally, Google’s Vertex AI includes an “Agents” product on the server side (Agents that can use tools like web search). But using that directly in iOS might not be straightforward unless exposed via an API.

However, you can implement a client-side agent: for instance, if the model’s response contains a specific pattern indicating an action (you’d have to design this prompt protocol yourself, since Google’s public API might not have a turnkey function calling yet as of May 2025), you can parse it and perform the action. Given that Google’s ecosystem is vast, one idea is to use Google’s other APIs in concert: e.g., if Gemini outputs something like <search query="...">, your app could call Google’s Custom Search API or an in-app WebView to fulfill it, then return the result to the conversation.

If your app is about code generation with Gemini (say using Codey model if available), plan for how to display multiple suggestions, allow the user to run code, etc. This is similar to OpenAI considerations.

One more note: the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an initiative (driven in part by Apple and partners) to create a standard way for AI models to interact with context and tools on device ￼. Anthropic, Google, OpenAI are all aware of it. If Apple provides any libraries for MCP in iOS 18+ (the Swift Package Index mention of SwiftClaude requiring iOS 18 suggests upcoming OS support ￼), keep an eye out as it might standardize agent integrations in the future. For now, each integration is custom.

iOS/macOS Specific Caveats (Google Gemini)

Firebase SDK size: Adding Firebase AI Logic will also bring in FirebaseCore and other dependencies. Make sure this fits your app size constraints. Also, Firebase requires minimum iOS 15+ as per the docs ￼.

API Key Security: If using Firebase, the Gemini API key lives in your Firebase project, not directly in the app (good for security). But ensure you enable App Check in Firebase (which attests valid app instances) to prevent others from abusing your API key with stolen config ￼. If you go without App Check initially (for dev), plan to add it for production.

App Store compliance: Similar to OpenAI, any AI-generated content must be filtered or age-restricted. Google’s models have their own safety filters (Gemini will often refuse or safe-complete certain prompts), but don’t rely solely on that. Since your app is responsible for content shown, consider an extra layer: e.g., don’t allow an image generation prompt if it likely violates content rules, or catch obviously disallowed outputs.

Network and Offline: If the user is offline, obviously these cloud calls won’t work – ensure your UI handles that (disable the send button or cache some fallback answers if appropriate). Also, Google’s endpoints might be blocked in some regions or enterprise networks – handle errors accordingly.

Overall, integrating Google’s Gemini in Swift is getting easier thanks to Firebase’s client SDK. It abstracts away OAuth and provides a more native-feeling API. The patterns (async calls, handling responses, streaming) are similar to OpenAI, with added complexity for multimodal features. Next, let’s look at Anthropic’s Claude integration.

Anthropic API Integration (Swift for iOS/macOS)

Anthropic offers the Claude family of models via its API. Claude is known for its large context and a chat-centric interface. As of 2025, Anthropic’s API is a lot like OpenAI’s, with some differences in endpoint and format. We’ll explore how to call Claude from Swift, including streaming via SSE, and any specific best practices.

Authentication & Configuration

Anthropic uses API keys for authentication as well. When you get access to Claude’s API (it might require signing up for an API key via their console), you’ll use a header x-api-key: YOUR_KEY on every request ￼ ￼. Unlike OpenAI’s “Bearer” auth, Anthropic’s key goes in a custom header. In Swift, set it like:

request.setValue("YOUR_API_KEY", forHTTPHeaderField: "x-api-key")

Additionally, Anthropic requires a version header for their API. As of the latest docs, you need an anthropic-version header, for example:

anthropic-version: 2023-06-01

(which was a stable version as of mid-2023; check for newer version strings in their docs). Also ensure Content-Type: application/json is set on requests ￼ ￼.

There’s no official Swift SDK from Anthropic at this time (they provide Python and TypeScript SDKs ￼). But the community has built some Swift packages (e.g. SwiftAnthropic ￼ and SwiftClaude). You can use those for convenience – for example, SwiftAnthropic wraps the HTTP calls and provides a nice Swift interface. Using such a library, you might initialize a client with your API key and call client.sendMessage() etc. If you prefer not to add a package, using URLSession as described is straightforward.

Structuring Requests (Claude’s chat format)

Anthropic’s main endpoint for Claude is POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages (they formerly had a /v1/complete for a legacy completion format, but now everything is unified as the “messages” API for chat) ￼ ￼. The JSON structure is similar to OpenAI’s chat, but with some nuances:
	•	The field for messages is "messages" and it takes an array of objects with "role" and "content" ￼ ￼. Roles are “system”, “user”, “assistant” as usual.
	•	The parameter for max tokens might be "max_tokens_to_sample" in older docs, but in the current Messages API it’s simply "max_tokens" ￼ (the example shows “max_tokens”: 1024).
	•	You also specify the model name, e.g. "claude-opus-4-20250514" (Claude models often have versions or dates in their names) ￼ ￼. Models could be Claude 2, Claude Instant, or Claude 4, etc., with IDs they publish.

For example, a request body could be:

{
  "model": "claude-2.1",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude!"}
  ],
  "max_tokens": 100
}

If you want to provide system instructions or few-shot examples, you include them in the messages array (Anthropic does not use a separate “system” vs “assistant” differentiation in behavior – it’s all part of the prompt sequence).

In Swift, create a struct for these message objects and an overall request struct, then encode to JSON. One quirk: Anthropic’s API might expect a stop sequence if you want to cut off the output at certain tokens/phrases (you can provide "stop_sequences": ["\n\nHuman:"] for example to stop when a new human prompt might start – since Anthropic’s older interface used “Human:” and “Assistant:” prefixes). If you don’t provide any, it will stop when it thinks the answer is done or it hits max_tokens.

The response from Claude’s API will include an id, the completion (content) which might be segmented by parts, and usage info. The content might come as an array of segments, especially if it included rich text or citations (Claude 2 can return arrays of content pieces with types, e.g. text vs code). For a basic use, you can concatenate all parts of content array (if present) or just take the string.

Streaming Responses via SSE

Anthropic’s API supports streaming using Server-Sent Events as well. You enable it by sending "stream": true in your request JSON ￼. The response will not come as one JSON, but as an SSE stream of events. Anthropic’s SSE sends various event types like message_start, content_block, message_delta, etc., which together compose the final message ￼ ￼. This is a bit more involved than OpenAI’s simpler stream.

Concretely, when streaming from Claude:
	•	First event: message_start with an empty content field indicating start.
	•	Then a series of content_block events – each block might correspond to a chunk of the message (and Claude might structure its output in blocks, e.g. a paragraph or a list item).
	•	Within each block, you get one or more content_block_delta events carrying the actual text content as it comes ￼.
	•	There will be content_block_stop marking end of that block, possibly then another block start if more content.
	•	You also get message_delta events which might update the metadata (like the stop reason or token count) as the message finalizes.
	•	Finally, a message_stop event signals the end ￼.

To handle this in Swift, you need to parse SSE events. The SSE data frames will have an event: name line and a data: {json} line. For example:

event: content_block_delta
data: {"type":"text","index":0,"delta":"Hello"}

You should read the stream line by line, identify lines starting with “event:” to know the type (though not strictly necessary if you just aggregate content), and lines starting with “data:”. You can ignore comments (lines starting with “:”, which Anthropic may send as keep-alive signals). Note that some SSE clients don’t automatically handle custom event types well ￼ ￼, so you might manually parse.

A simple approach: treat any data: ... line that contains a "delta" or text as part of the output and append it to your output string. Continue until you receive an event message_stop. The Anthropic Python/TS SDKs provide logic to reconstruct the message from these events, and you might mimic that. For instance, you may ignore message_delta events except perhaps to read a stop_reason or usage field at the end.

In Swift, the same streaming techniques using URLSession apply. One thing to watch out: Anthropic SSE sends event names which some out-of-the-box SSE parsers might not expect. If you use a library like EventSource, ensure it can handle custom events or treat everything as generic. Alternatively, a manual parser that looks for \nevent: and \ndata: patterns can be implemented.

Error Handling & Rate Limits for Anthropic

Anthropic’s error handling is similar to OpenAI’s. If you use an invalid API key or your key has no credit, you’ll get 401/403 errors. Rate limiting (429) can happen if you send too many requests or tokens beyond your allocation. Since Anthropic’s models often have large context (100k tokens for Claude 2), be mindful that very large prompts may be slow or expensive – Anthropic may have tighter rate limits on highest context usage. The error message from the API will guide what went wrong.

One notable difference: Anthropic’s API might return model capacity errors if the model is overloaded or if your account isn’t allowed that model. For example, if Claude 2 of a certain size is in limited beta, you might get an error telling you it’s not available. Handle those gracefully (perhaps fall back to a smaller model like Claude Instant if available).

Check the anthropic-organization-id header in responses too – it’s mostly informational (your org ID) ￼. Logging the request-id (returned in headers) for failed requests is useful for support, as Anthropic can trace issues with that.

Anthropic’s rate limits aren’t publicly documented in detail, but assume something like a limited number of tokens per minute depending on your plan. Implement a similar backoff strategy. Possibly, because Anthropic keys might be harder to get (invite-only at times), the usage might be less heavy unless you have a paid arrangement.

Prompt/Result Caching Strategies

Claude’s strengths include large contexts and consistent behavior, which might reduce the need to call repeatedly for refining an answer. But caching is still useful. For example, if your app uses Claude to analyze a fixed piece of text (say a document) and answer questions, you might cache the analysis or the answers for known questions. Since Claude can handle a lot of text, one approach is to cache embeddings or intermediate results if you implement retrieval augmentation (though Anthropic’s API doesn’t yet have an embedding endpoint like OpenAI does).

A straightforward cache for Claude’s responses: use the user’s question as key. But if you have conversational context, the key should perhaps include some representation of conversation state (which gets complicated). Likely, caching is most feasible for single-turn queries or expensive operations. Given Claude’s context window, you might also cache partial conversations: e.g., if your agent had a lengthy reasoning chain with Claude, and the user asks to revisit a step, you could reuse Claude’s prior output from cache instead of recomputing.

One must also consider Anthropic’s terms: they don’t forbid caching outputs locally, but they do forbid using outputs in ways that violate their policies. Since caching is internal, it’s fine as long as you’re not republishing the model’s output without attribution or review (which you likely aren’t – it’s within your app for the same user).

Swift Usage Examples and Community Libraries

A Medium post by James Rochabrun (Feb 2024) details using SwiftAnthropic, a Swift package he created to integrate Claude ￼ ￼. That article walks through setting up the package and sending a prompt to Claude’s API. For instance, with SwiftAnthropic, after adding it via SPM, you might do something like:

let client = AnthropicClient(apiKey: "x-api-key-...")
let request = CompletionRequest(prompt: "Human: \(userInput)\n\nAssistant:", model: .claudeInstant)
let response = try await client.complete(request)
// Then use response.completion

(This pseudocode illustrates how a wrapper can make the API look more high-level; the actual API might differ). The author’s GitHub shows usage of the messages endpoint and how to handle streaming via a Combine publisher or async sequence.

Another example is SwiftClaude by George Lyon ￼, which mentions requiring Swift 6 and iOS 18 – likely forward-looking, possibly to leverage new Swift features or OS support. Even if you don’t use these libraries, perusing their code can be educational to see how they manage the HTTP calls and streaming parsing in Swift.

Real-world usage: by 2025, some iOS apps and tools have integrated Claude for specific tasks. For instance, there are Mac apps that use Claude for large-text summarization. They often split a document and send multiple prompts to Claude, assembling the result. If implementing something like that, you’d need to orchestrate multiple API calls and perhaps use Claude’s ability to follow instructions about format (Claude is known to follow format requests well). Always test with the actual model, as each LLM has quirks.

Agent/Tool Use with Claude

Claude is designed to be helpful and follows a “Constitutional AI” approach (it tries to be harmless/helpful by design). It doesn’t natively have a function calling API like OpenAI, but you can simulate tool use with prompt patterns. For example, you can include a convention in the prompt: “If you need to use a tool, output a line like Tool: <toolname> <parameters> and wait.” Your app can detect that in Claude’s output, perform the action, and then append the result to the conversation. This is essentially the ReAct pattern via text. Claude’s 100k token context allows it to carry a lot of reasoning, which is great for agent scenarios on large data.

Architecturally, implementing an agent loop with Claude means: send user query to Claude, get output; if output indicates a tool usage (you have to define this protocol), do the tool action in Swift, then send a new prompt to Claude continuing the conversation (include the tool’s result). Loop until completion. Make sure to guard against infinite loops or irrelevant tool use.

One advantage: Anthropic’s Claude tends to follow instructions like “If the user asks for disallowed content, respond with a refusal” on its own. So moderation burden is slightly less on you (though not eliminated – you should still enforce your content rules).

iOS/macOS Specific Considerations (Anthropic)

Obtaining API Access: As of early 2025, getting an Anthropic API key might require a waitlist or partnership. So in testing your app, use your developer key, but if you plan to ship broadly, ensure that either Anthropic is okay with your usage or allow BYO-key (Have users enter their own key, similar to some OpenAI client apps). This is a product decision: BYO-key avoids you paying for usage and sidesteps key security issues (user brings their own key from Anthropic), but it’s a higher barrier to entry for users.

Networking: Nothing special beyond what we covered. The endpoint is a standard HTTPS endpoint. Response sizes can be huge (if you request a 20k token output, that’s a lot of data), so be mindful of memory. You might stream in that case to avoid holding the entire response in memory at once.

App Review: If using Claude, same content concerns apply as previous – filter or age-gate. Also, because Claude can handle very large inputs, if your app allows user to paste a whole book and get a summary, consider the performance and cost implications (maybe chunk the input, or require the user to be on Wi-Fi, etc., to avoid huge cellular data usage).

Secure storage: The Anthropic API key is similar to OpenAI’s in sensitivity. Do not include it in the app binary. If it’s your key and you call Anthropic from the app, that’s even riskier because those keys often have higher privileges (access to Claude Instant, Claude 2, etc.). It would be safer to route through a server you control. But if you must call direct, treat it like the OpenAI case: store in Keychain or use user-provided keys.

In summary, integrating Anthropic’s Claude in Swift is quite similar to OpenAI’s integration – the patterns (auth header, JSON body, SSE streaming) map closely. Use available community tools to save time, and always respect the usage policies.

OpenRouter API Integration (Swift for iOS/macOS)

OpenRouter is a unified API that can proxy requests to many different models/providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and also open-source models). Its goal is “one API for any model” ￼. Integrating OpenRouter allows your app to access multiple model backends with a single integration. We’ll cover how to authenticate and use OpenRouter in Swift, and the unique considerations (like model routing and cost management).

Authentication & Configuration

OpenRouter provides its own API keys. You sign up at openrouter.ai to get a key (or in some cases, OpenRouter can use your existing provider API keys under the hood with a BYOK approach, but the simplest is to use their unified key). Authentication is similar to OpenAI’s: you use an Authorization header with Bearer token. For example:

Authorization: Bearer OPENROUTER_API_KEY

￼. No other header is strictly required to use it. (OpenRouter does allow some optional headers like HTTP-Referer and X-Title to identify your app for their leaderboard, but those are not necessary for functionality ￼ ￼.)

In Swift, set the header on your URLRequest as usual. The base URL for OpenRouter is https://openrouter.ai/api/v1. You will be hitting OpenRouter’s endpoints instead of the provider’s endpoints directly.

Sending Requests (Unified Chat Completions)

OpenRouter’s API is OpenAI-compatible by design. That means you can often use the same JSON you’d send to OpenAI’s /v1/chat/completions and just change the URL to OpenRouter’s. Indeed, OpenRouter’s documentation says the OpenAI SDKs can work by just pointing them to the OpenRouter base URL ￼ ￼. The core endpoint for chat is:

POST https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions

and for a raw completion (if needed):

POST https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/completions

The JSON body should include the "model" you want, in a namespaced format. For example, to request GPT-4 via OpenRouter, you might do "model": "openai/gpt-4"; to request Claude, "model": "anthropic/claude-2"; for an open model like Mistral: "model": "mistralai/mistral-7b" (just illustrative) ￼ ￼. If you omit the model, OpenRouter may use a default or you might get an error – always specify the model.

Example request body:

{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, explain OpenRouter."}
  ]
}

This looks just like an OpenAI request, except the model includes a provider prefix. OpenRouter will route it to the appropriate API (in this case OpenAI’s GPT-4) using their credentials or your linked credentials.

In Swift, you can reuse the same structs you made for OpenAI’s chat. You might just need to add a field for model if it wasn’t already in your struct. Then change the URL to the OpenRouter endpoint.

Streaming: OpenRouter supports streaming as well – just include stream: true in the JSON, and you’ll get an SSE stream back ￼. The streaming format is basically the same as OpenAI’s (since it’s proxying OpenAI or converting other models’ outputs to that format). One difference: OpenRouter sends periodic comment messages in SSE (: OPENROUTER PROCESSING) to keep the connection alive ￼. These lines begin with a : and can be ignored (as per SSE spec they are comments) ￼. They can be used if you want to display a loading indicator (“model is thinking…”) before any real data arrives. Ensure your SSE parser ignores lines starting with : or handles them properly ￼.

Error Handling and Rate Limits

When using OpenRouter, some errors might come from OpenRouter itself and others from the underlying model provider. OpenRouter will unify these as much as possible. For example, if your OpenRouter API key is invalid or you exceed OpenRouter’s usage limits, you’ll get an error from OpenRouter (likely a 401 or 429 with a message). If the underlying model call fails (say OpenAI has an internal error), OpenRouter might forward that error or translate it.

The best approach is to implement error handling just as you would for OpenAI: check for HTTP 400/401/429/500 and handle/retry accordingly. OpenRouter’s documentation mentions usage accounting and limits ￼, and you can even check your credit balance via their API (they have an endpoint for credits). If your app plans to use OpenRouter as a one-stop shop, you might call GET /credits to ensure you have enough balance, and warn the user if not.

OpenRouter may have rate limits of its own (to protect their service). Those might be somewhat high if you’re a paying user. If using their free access to certain models (OpenRouter offers some free tiers for certain open models), those could be rate-limited more strictly. In any case, implement backoff on 429 as usual.

One nice thing: if a specific model is down or overloaded, OpenRouter can automatically fall back to another model if you allow. But by default, if you requested a specific model and it fails, you’ll get an error.

Token Costs and Logging

OpenRouter can unify billing for multiple models. If you’re using OpenRouter’s paid plan, you might get a single bill for usage across OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. This simplifies things, but also means you should keep an eye on usage. The usage field in responses (for OpenAI-compatible models) should still be present. However, if you call a model like an open one (e.g. a local model via OpenRouter), they may not return token counts. OpenRouter’s own docs mention a feature called “Reasoning Tokens” to account for usage across models ￼.

For cost estimation, since OpenRouter uses others’ models, refer to those models’ token prices. OpenRouter itself might add a surcharge or use slightly different pricing (particularly if it offers convenience features). Always check OpenRouter’s pricing page.

Prompt/Result Caching with OpenRouter

Using OpenRouter doesn’t change caching strategy much – you still cache at the application level. However, OpenRouter does have a feature for prompt caching on their side ￼. It’s not entirely transparent; it’s more of a developer feature to reuse results for identical requests to save your credits. If enabled, OpenRouter might return a stored result for repeated prompts (especially for expensive models), reducing latency. This is something configured on their platform (possibly via your developer settings or API flags).

Regardless, you can implement your own cache as described before. One interesting idea: since OpenRouter allows many models, you might cache per model. For example, if a user first asks using GPT-4 (via OpenRouter) and then later asks the exact same question using Claude (via OpenRouter), do you consider that a cache hit? Probably not, because model outputs differ. So include the model name in your cache key.

If caching intermediate agent steps, OpenRouter doesn’t directly affect that except you might use different models for different steps (some workflows use a cheap model for certain tasks and a powerful model for final answer – OpenRouter could orchestrate that on the server side, but you can also do it client-side by choosing models).

Real-World Example and Usage

A blog post by Natasha (NatashaTheRobot) in April 2025 specifically described integrating OpenRouter into a Swift app ￼ ￼. While the full content is behind a subscription, the summary is that it’s quite straightforward if you’ve done OpenAI integration: you point your API calls to OpenRouter and specify the model. She highlights the benefit of “unified, low-latency access across hundreds of LLMs” ￼ ￼ – for a developer, this means you can dynamically choose models (maybe allow the user to pick GPT-4 vs Claude vs others in your app settings).

Another community reference: a Reddit post where a developer built an iOS app “LLMConnect” supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter in one interface ￼. They likely created a protocol for LLM service and had concrete classes for each integration, showing that OpenRouter’s implementation would be the smallest (since it can mimic OpenAI’s) and can serve as a fallback if other keys aren’t provided.

OpenRouter also provides third-party SDKs and mentions that OpenAI’s own libraries can be used by changing the base URL ￼ ￼. For Swift, that means if you were using the MacPaw OpenAI SDK, you could configure it with Configuration(host: "openrouter.ai", basePath: "/api/v1") and your OpenRouter key – it would then send requests to OpenRouter while using the OpenAI-compatible format. Indeed, the MacPaw SDK mentions it can work with other OpenAI-compatible endpoints if you set custom host and headers ￼. This is a neat shortcut: use a well-tested OpenAI client and just repoint it.

Agent Workflows and OpenRouter

OpenRouter itself has some advanced features like Tool calling and Web search integrated on their side ￼. For instance, they have a “tools” feature where you can allow the model to call a web search through OpenRouter’s infrastructure. If you enable that, you might just get final answers, or the model’s output might include references. However, using such features might require specific parameters or prompt formats. Check OpenRouter’s docs if interested – they aim to simplify agent building by handling some tools if you opt in.

From the app’s perspective, if you keep things simple and just call OpenRouter for answers, you might not need to implement your own tool-use logic; you could delegate it to OpenRouter if they support the tools you need (for example, if you want the model to sometimes use a calculator, OpenRouter could handle that if it has a calculator plugin enabled). But this ties your app’s behavior to OpenRouter’s services and might reduce transparency. Alternatively, you do it client-side as previously described, using OpenRouter just as a model provider.

OpenRouter’s “Ranking” feature is another interesting one: it can automatically choose the “best” model for a query (balancing quality and cost) if you don’t specify one. If you use that, your app may get varied responses (some from GPT-4, some from an open model, etc.). This could complicate caching (since two runs of the same prompt might use different models depending on availability). If consistency is needed, specify the model explicitly. If cost savings are critical, you might let OpenRouter choose via their routing logic.

iOS/macOS Specific Caveats (OpenRouter)

Network calls: You’re calling openrouter.ai – which is an external service but still HTTPS, so fine for ATS. Ensure to include the full path “/api/v1/…”, some developers accidentally do /v1/... on openrouter.ai which won’t work (404) ￼. Minor detail but worth noting: the base path includes /api/v1.

API Key Security: The OpenRouter key, like others, should be kept secret. However, if your OpenRouter account is effectively a proxy to your other keys, a leak could be even worse (someone could use your OpenRouter key to run up bills on all integrated providers). Thus, same precautions: don’t embed plainly. If you expect users to bring their own keys for various services, note that OpenRouter could simplify that (one key instead of managing 3 different keys), but then the user must trust OpenRouter and you to handle their requests.

App Store compliance: No change – AI content is AI content, regardless of route. But one note: if you use OpenRouter to access models like Meta’s Llama-family or other open models, those might not have as robust filtering as OpenAI/Claude. Ensure your content moderation strategy accounts for the least filtered model you call. For example, GPT-4 might refuse to produce certain content, but an open model might not and could produce disallowed content. If your app allows switching models, you can’t just rely on the model to refuse – you need to possibly put your own guardrails (like a pre-check on user prompt for extremely unsafe queries, and either disallow or modify before sending to a less-restricted model).

Performance considerations: Using OpenRouter adds a tiny bit of overhead (one extra network hop through their server). In practice, latency is still dominated by the model’s generation time. But for very latency-sensitive use cases, it’s something to be aware of. If OpenRouter’s server is geographically far from your users, there could be added latency. As of 2025, OpenRouter is a cloud service likely with global nodes, so this is minor.

Dependency management: If you plan to support multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and OpenRouter in one app, be careful to keep your code organized. Potentially use dependency injection or distinct classes so you don’t mix up endpoints. For instance, you might have an LLMServiceType enum for .openAI, .anthropic, .google, .openRouter and a service factory. Or if primarily using OpenRouter, maybe keep the others as fallback only.

Finally, remember OpenRouter is a third-party service – if it goes down, your app’s AI features go down even if underlying providers are fine. So a robust app might implement a fallback: e.g., if an OpenRouter request fails due to OpenRouter issues, try calling the provider API directly (if you have those keys). That’s more work, but provides resilience. Monitor OpenRouter’s status or at least catch errors and inform the user appropriately (“Service is temporarily unavailable, please try again.”).

Conclusion and Best Practices

Integrating AI APIs like OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, and OpenRouter into Swift apps is now a well-trodden path. In summary, follow these key guidelines:
	•	Authentication: Use secure methods to handle API keys (never commit them to source control or hardcode in app binaries). Prefer user-supplied keys or secure retrieval from your server. Configure the necessary headers (Authorization: Bearer or x-api-key as required) ￼ ￼.
	•	Requests & Responses: Construct JSON requests using Swift’s Codable for clarity and safety. Test your JSON structure with examples (many provider docs include curl examples you can replicate in Swift) ￼. Decode responses into Swift models for easier handling of fields like content, usage, etc. Leverage async/await to keep code readable.
	•	Streaming: Embrace streaming for better UX – users like to see the answer forming. Implement SSE handling with URLSession or use existing streaming support in community SDKs ￼. Parse partial data carefully, and update UI incrementally on the main thread.
	•	Error and Rate Limit Handling: Always handle error cases in network calls. Use do-catch and inspect HTTP status. Implement retry with backoff for 429 rate limits ￼, and educate the user if they hit usage limits (e.g., “You’ve reached the hourly limit, please wait.”). Log or display meaningful error messages (but avoid leaking sensitive info). For development, print out response error bodies to debug issues like invalid JSON or parameter errors.
	•	Rate limiting & batching: If your app might fire off many requests (e.g. user rapidly asks multiple questions or you have parallel tasks using the API), introduce a simple request queue or semaphore to throttle calls. This prevents hitting provider limits and also avoids network overload on mobile data.
	•	Caching & Offline: Implement caching of results to save cost and time, as discussed. Also design a fallback for offline mode – maybe allow reading cached Q&A or notify the user gracefully that internet is required for AI features.
	•	Security & Privacy: Store any conversation data securely if you keep it on device. If sending any private/sensitive user data to these APIs, disclose this in your privacy policy because it’s being sent to third-party servers. Use HTTPS (all these APIs require it anyway). Consider using Apple’s Secure Enclave or Keychain for API keys or sensitive cached content if applicable.
	•	Content moderation & App Review: Use available moderation tools (OpenAI’s or your own filters) to reduce the chance of exposing disallowed content. Clearly communicate AI usage to users and set the appropriate age rating or filtering to satisfy App Store guidelines ￼.
	•	Performance: Load and initialize any SDKs (like Firebase) early (e.g., at app launch) to avoid runtime latency when the user asks something. However, avoid blocking the main thread – do network calls in background. If using Combine or Swift Concurrency, take advantage of asynchronous streams for smooth data handling.
	•	Maintainability: Abstract each API integration behind a protocol or service class. This way, your UI code doesn’t directly depend on, say, URLSession details for each provider. It also makes it easier to swap implementations or use OpenRouter as a single integration point. Keep model identifiers and endpoints configurable (you might want to update to new model versions without app updates, by fetching from a config file or remote).
	•	Stay Updated: The LLM field is evolving rapidly. As of May 2025, new features like function calling, vision input, and larger context windows are emerging. Keep an eye on the latest docs and community forums for each provider. Upgrading to new SDK versions (Firebase AI Logic updates, community Swift packages updates) will bring in support for new API capabilities.

By following this guide, a Swift developer can confidently integrate state-of-the-art AI models into iOS and macOS apps. With careful attention to correctness, security, and user experience, these AI features can greatly enhance apps – from smart chatbots and assistants to content generation, coding help, and beyond. Happy coding with your new AI-powered Swift app!
