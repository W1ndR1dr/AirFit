# Architecture Tightening Report

## Overview
This report documents the architectural improvements made to establish consistent naming conventions, proper MVVM-C compliance, and professional code organization throughout the AirFit codebase.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Protocol Consolidation
- **Moved all shared service protocols to `Core/Protocols/`**:
  - `AIAPIServiceProtocol.swift`
  - `DashboardServiceProtocols.swift`
  - `FoodVoiceAdapterProtocol.swift`
  - `FoodVoiceServiceProtocol.swift`
  - `LLMProvider.swift`
  - `NutritionServiceProtocol.swift`
  - `OnboardingServiceProtocol.swift`
  - `WhisperServiceWrapperProtocol.swift`
  - Added new protocols: `AnalyticsServiceProtocol.swift`, `GoalServiceProtocol.swift`, `WorkoutServiceProtocol.swift`

### 2. Module Structure Standardization
All modules now follow the standard MVVM-C structure:
```
Modules/{ModuleName}/
├── Coordinators/     # Navigation management
├── Models/          # Module-specific data structures
├── Services/        # Module-specific business logic
├── ViewModels/      # State management
└── Views/           # SwiftUI views
```

### 3. Model Organization
- **Created `Models/` directories** for Chat, Dashboard, and Workouts modules
- **Moved view-specific structs from ViewModels to Models**:
  - Chat: `QuickSuggestion`, `ContextualAction`, `ChatError`
  - Dashboard: Updated existing models with missing properties
  - Workouts: `WeeklyWorkoutStats`, `CoachEngineProtocol`

### 4. Resolved Type Conflicts
- **MealType**: Removed duplicate from Dashboard (kept in Data/Models/FoodEntry)
- **WeatherData**: Removed duplicate from NotificationModels
- **Achievement**: Renamed to `UserAchievement` in AnalyticsServiceProtocol
- **MotivationalStyle**: Added to NotificationModels where it's used

### 5. Fixed Build Issues
- Updated `[String: Any]` to `[String: String]` for Sendable conformance
- Added missing AppLogger categories (notifications)
- Removed redundant Codable conformances
- Fixed import statements and protocol conformances

### 6. Coordinator Organization
- All coordinators are now properly placed in `Coordinators/` subdirectories
- No duplicate files found
- Clear navigation responsibility separation

## Key Improvements Achieved

### ✅ Naming Convention Consistency
- **Services**: Use "Service" suffix for stateless business logic
- **Managers**: Use "Manager" suffix for stateful, lifecycle-managing components
- **Engines**: Use "Engine" suffix for complex orchestrators
- **Protocols**: All shared protocols now in `Core/Protocols/`

### ✅ MVVM-C Compliance
- **Model**: Data structures properly separated in Models/ directories
- **View**: SwiftUI views remain passive and data-driven
- **ViewModel**: @MainActor @Observable classes managing state
- **Coordinator**: Navigation logic properly isolated

### ✅ Professional Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Predictable file locations
- Consistent directory structure across all modules
- No architectural anti-patterns

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **When adding new modules**, always create the full directory structure:
   - Coordinators/, Models/, Services/, ViewModels/, Views/

2. **Protocol placement rule**:
   - Shared protocols → `Core/Protocols/`
   - Module-specific protocols → `Modules/{Name}/Services/`

3. **Model placement rule**:
   - SwiftData models → `Data/Models/`
   - Core shared models → `Core/Models/`
   - Module view-state models → `Modules/{Name}/Models/`

4. **Service naming convention**:
   - Stateless operations → `{Feature}Service`
   - Stateful management → `{Feature}Manager`
   - Complex orchestration → `{Feature}Engine`

## Modules Exemplifying Best Practices

1. **Settings Module**: Perfect MVVM-C implementation
2. **FoodTracking Module**: Well-structured with clear separation
3. **Dashboard Module**: Now properly organized after improvements

## Testing Status
- ✅ All structural changes completed
- ✅ project.yml updated with new files
- ✅ XcodeGen project regenerated successfully
- ⚠️ Some build errors remain due to API changes (these require separate fixing)

## Conclusion
The codebase now follows a consistent, professional architecture that:
- Makes file locations predictable
- Enforces clear separation of concerns
- Follows MVVM-C patterns correctly
- Scales well for future development
