## Current Architecture Overview

### High-Level Structure
```
AirFitApp (SwiftUI App)
    ├── DIContainer initialization
    ├── ModelContainer setup
    └── ContentView
            ├── AppState creation
            ├── Navigation logic
            └── View routing
```

### Key Components
1. **DIContainer**: Modern dependency injection system
2. **ServiceProtocol**: Base protocol for all services (marked @MainActor)
3. **AI Services**: Multiple implementations (AIService, DemoAIService, OfflineAIService)
4. **AppState**: Global state management (@MainActor, @Observable)

## The Black Screen Issue

### Root Cause Analysis

The black screen occurs because:

1. **Initialization Flow**:
   ```
   AirFitApp.initializeApp() 
       → DIBootstrapper.createAppContainer()
       → ContentView appears
       → ContentView.createAppState() [HANGS HERE]
   ```

2. **The Hang Point**:
   - ContentView tries to resolve `APIKeyManagementProtocol` from DIContainer
   - APIKeyManager was marked as `@MainActor`
   - Resolution happens in a Task (not on MainActor)
   - Actor isolation conflict causes deadlock

### Current State After Changes
- Removed @MainActor from ServiceProtocol
- Removed @MainActor from AIServiceProtocol
- Changed APIKeyManager from @MainActor to actor
- Started updating service implementations (incomplete)

## Actor Isolation Analysis

### Original Design
Everything was `@MainActor`:
- ✅ Simple - no actor isolation issues
- ✅ UI updates were straightforward
- ❌ Not ideal for concurrent operations
- ❌ Forced all service operations to main thread

### Current Mixed State
- Some services are actors
- Some are @MainActor classes
- Some protocols require @MainActor
- **This inconsistency is causing build failures**

### Architectural Options

1. **All @MainActor** (Original)
   - Pros: Simple, works, no isolation issues
   - Cons: Not concurrent, everything on main thread

2. **Proper Actor Isolation** (Attempted)
   - Pros: Better concurrency, proper isolation
   - Cons: Complex migration, many changes needed

3. **Hybrid Approach** (Recommended)
   - Keep ViewModels as @MainActor
   - Services as actors or regular classes
   - Clear boundaries between UI and business logic

## Dependency Injection System

### Current DIContainer Design
```swift
public final class DIContainer: @unchecked Sendable {
    private var registrations: [ObjectIdentifier: Registration] = [:]
    private var singletonInstances: [ObjectIdentifier: Any] = [:]
    
    public func resolve<T>(_ type: T.Type) async throws -> T
}
```

### Registration Pattern
```swift
container.register(APIKeyManagementProtocol.self, lifetime: .singleton) { container in
    let keychain = try await container.resolve(KeychainWrapper.self)
    return APIKeyManager(keychain: keychain)
}
```

### Issues
1. Async resolution can cause actor isolation conflicts
2. No compile-time safety
3. Circular dependency potential

## Service Layer Architecture

### Service Hierarchy
```
ServiceProtocol
    ├── AIServiceProtocol
    │   ├── AIService
    │   ├── DemoAIService
    │   └── OfflineAIService
    ├── WeatherServiceProtocol
    │   └── WeatherService
    └── APIKeyManagementProtocol
        └── APIKeyManager
```

### Protocol Requirements
```swift
protocol ServiceProtocol: AnyObject, Sendable {
    var isConfigured: Bool { get }
    var serviceIdentifier: String { get }
    func configure() async throws
    func reset() async
    func healthCheck() async -> ServiceHealth
}
```

## AI Integration Patterns

### Current AI Service Strategy
1. Check for demo mode → DemoAIService
2. Check for API keys → AIService or DemoAIService
3. No offline fallback anymore (per user decision)

### LLM Orchestrator Pattern
- Manages multiple AI providers
- Handles fallback between providers
- Cost tracking and model selection

## Key Architectural Decisions

### What's Working
1. SwiftUI + SwiftData integration
2. HealthKit dual storage pattern
3. Modular structure (MVVM-C)
4. DIContainer for dependency management

### What's Not Working
1. Actor isolation inconsistency
2. Complex initialization flow
3. Mixed concurrency patterns
4. Demo/offline mode complexity

## Problems Identified

### Critical Issues
1. **Black Screen**: App hangs during initialization
2. **Actor Isolation**: Inconsistent use of actors vs @MainActor
3. **Build Failures**: Many services need updates after protocol changes

### Design Issues
1. **Over-Engineering**: Demo mode adds complexity without value
2. **Unclear Boundaries**: Services doing UI work
3. **Initialization Order**: Complex dependency chains

### Technical Debt
1. Incomplete actor migration
2. Mixed async/sync patterns
3. Deprecated patterns still in use

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Fix (for Black Screen)
1. **Option A**: Revert all actor changes, restore @MainActor everywhere
2. **Option B**: Complete the actor migration properly
3. **Option C**: Simplify initialization to avoid the issue

### Long-Term Architecture

#### 1. Clear Layer Separation
```
UI Layer (@MainActor)
    ├── Views
    ├── ViewModels 
    └── Coordinators

Service Layer (Actors/Classes)
    ├── Business Logic
    ├── Network/API
    └── Data Access
```

#### 2. Simplified Service Pattern
```swift
// Remove ServiceProtocol requirement
// Make services focused and simple
actor APIKeyManager {
    func getKey(for provider: AIProvider) async throws -> String
    func saveKey(_ key: String, for provider: AIProvider) async throws
}
```

#### 3. Initialization Simplification
```swift
// Synchronous DI resolution where possible
// Async only when truly needed
// Clear initialization phases
```

### Migration Plan

1. **Phase 1: Stabilize**
   - Fix black screen issue
   - Get app running again
   - Document current state

2. **Phase 2: Simplify**
   - Remove demo mode completely
   - Simplify service protocols
   - Clean up initialization

3. **Phase 3: Modernize**
   - Proper actor isolation
   - Clean architectural boundaries
   - Consistent patterns throughout

## Next Steps

1. **Decision Required**: Which approach for immediate fix?
2. **Document**: Create detailed migration plan
3. **Execute**: Systematic changes with testing
4. **Validate**: Ensure each step maintains functionality
