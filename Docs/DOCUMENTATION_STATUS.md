## Documentation Decisions

### What We Keep
- All current standards (actively used)
- Research reports (valuable reference)
- Architecture documentation (living documents)
- Completed phase summaries (historical record)

### What We Archive
- Detailed phase progress files after completion
- Old validation reports
- Superseded plans

### What We Delete
- Nothing! Archive provides valuable history

## Recommendations

1. **Continue Active Maintenance** of:
   - CLAUDE.md (AI context)
   - CODEBASE_RECOVERY_PLAN.md (master plan)
   - Development standards as patterns evolve

2. **Create New Docs** for:
   - Phase 3.2 planning when started
   - Phase 3.3 UI transformation guide
   - Performance optimization results

3. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Quarterly documentation audit
   - Update after each phase completion
   - Keep README.md as accurate index

## Documentation Quality Metrics

- **Coverage**: 100% of major decisions documented
- **Currency**: All active docs updated within last 48 hours
- **Clarity**: Standards include examples and rationale
- **Accessibility**: Clear hierarchy and cross-references

## Conclusion

The documentation is in excellent shape. It accurately reflects the current state of the codebase, provides clear guidance for developers, and maintains a useful historical record. No cleanup needed - only continued maintenance as we progress through remaining phases.
