Prompt/Context Caching in Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, and Google Gemini

Anthropic (Claude) – Context Caching

Current Implementation

Support and Syntax: Anthropic’s Messages API supports prompt caching via a cache_control parameter on any content block in the request ￼ ￼. You mark the end of a reusable prompt prefix by adding "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"} to that block’s JSON. For example, to cache a large system prompt you could do:

{
  "model": "claude-4-opus", 
  "system": [
    {"type": "text", "text": "You are a helpful fitness coach..."},
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "<long persona or document text>",
      "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}
    }
  ],
  "messages": [ { "role": "user", "content": "User's query here" } ]
}

This tells Claude to treat everything up to that block as a cacheable prefix ￼. (Earlier in 2024 this feature was beta-gated by a header, but it’s now generally available.) Currently “ephemeral” is the only cache type, with a default TTL of 5 minutes ￼. An extended 1-hour TTL is available by including the beta header extended-cache-ttl-2025-04-11 and specifying "ttl": "1h" in the cache_control object ￼. No other cache types (like persistent beyond 1h) are yet supported.

Technical Details

Token Limits: The minimum prompt length to trigger caching is 1024 tokens (2048 for older smaller models) ￼. Prompts shorter than that are processed normally (they won’t be cached). There isn’t a hard “max” cache size beyond the model’s context limit – you can cache very large texts (the docs even demonstrate caching an entire novel) ￼.

What Can Be Cached: Virtually any static content in the prompt can be cached. This includes tool definitions in the tools array, system instruction blocks, and even user/assistant message content blocks ￼. In practice, you can cache system prompts (e.g. role or persona descriptions) and large context passages. You can also cache previous conversation turns (assistant replies or user messages) if you mark them appropriately, though usually the initial instructions or background data yield the biggest benefit. Tool definitions can be cached by marking the last tool in the tools list with cache_control, which caches all tools as a single prefix ￼ ￼. Multiple cache segments: Anthropic supports up to 4 cache breakpoints in one prompt ￼. That means you can designate several sections of your prompt to cache separately – e.g. one after tools, one after system instructions, one after a long document, etc. Each cache_control marker creates a checkpoint; on subsequent calls the API will attempt to match the longest cached prefix available ￼.

Streaming: Prompt caching works with streaming responses as well. The cache entry is created once the response starts streaming, and the usage metrics (like cache hit tokens) are included in the initial message_start event ￼. So you can absolutely use caching in combination with AsyncStream without issue – you’ll still get the speed/cost benefits on the prompt processing side.

Functions/Tools and Other Details: As noted, tool definitions can be cached. “Thinking” blocks (Claude’s chain-of-thought from its Extended Thinking mode) cannot be explicitly marked for caching, but if they were part of a previous assistant response that got cached, they will be included when that prefix is reused ￼. Generally, any content block that is identical across calls can be cached – but exact match is required (including punctuation, whitespace, etc.) for a cache hit ￼.

Costs & Limits

Cost Reduction: Cached input tokens on Anthropic are ~90% cheaper than normal tokens. Specifically, reading tokens from cache is billed at 0.1× the normal input token price ￼. There is an upfront cost to create the cache: caching a prefix for 5 minutes costs 1.25× the normal rate for those tokens (and 2× if using the 1-hour cache) ￼. In return, every reuse of that prefix within TTL costs only 10% of normal. For example, if you cache a 10K-token prompt, you pay ~12.5K tokens worth once, then each subsequent call using it pays only 1K tokens worth for that part ￼. This can result in substantial savings if a large context is reused multiple times. The pricing table for different Claude models reflects these factors (see Anthropic’s pricing docs ￼).

Rate Limits: Anthropic does not impose special rate limits on cached requests – the same request/sec limits apply. The token limits (max context length) also include cached tokens. In other words, if you have a 100K context model and cache 90K of tokens, you can still only add ~10K new tokens in a request. The cache doesn’t expand the model’s capacity, it just makes reuse cheaper. According to Anthropic, there are no separate rate limits or quotas for using the cache ￼. One caveat: a cache entry only becomes available after the first request finishes processing. So if you try to send many requests in parallel all including the same new large prefix, only the first one will actually create the cache; the rest won’t benefit because the cache wasn’t ready yet ￼. It’s best to sequence the initial request and then fire off parallel ones to hit the cache.

Cache Invalidation: The cache is invalidated if any portion of the cached prefix changes. Claude’s caching follows a hierarchy: tools → system → messages ￼. Changing something in the tools section invalidates the entire cache (since tools are the first part). Changing a system instruction invalidates the system and messages cache (but a tools-only prefix might still be valid) ￼. Changes in the messages (e.g. adding/removing an image or altering a user message) invalidate the message portion of the cache but not the earlier tools/system prefixes ￼. In practice, to get a cache hit, you must supply an identical prompt prefix (same text, same ordering of blocks, same tool usage, etc.) up to the cache marker ￼. TTL expiration is another cause of invalidation – by default the cache entry is evicted after 5 minutes of no use (or after 1 hour, if you used the extended TTL option) ￼ ￼. If an entry expires, the next request will recalc that prefix (and refresh the cache).

Best Practices

Conversation Continuity: For multi-turn conversations, the recommended pattern is to cache stable system instructions at the start, and let the conversation messages accrue after. Claude will automatically utilize previously cached segments as the conversation grows ￼ ￼. For example, you might mark your long system persona prompt with cache_control on the first request. On the second user query, send the same system prompt (with the marker) plus the prior Q&A – Claude will fetch the system part from cache and only process the new turn normally. You can even incrementally cache parts of the conversation: e.g. mark a particularly large assistant answer with cache_control so that it doesn’t fully re-process on later turns. (Anthropic allows caching of assistant/user message blocks in the messages list as they become “static” context in subsequent calls ￼.) In practice, many developers simply cache the system prompt and any large supporting context, while treating the live conversation turns as dynamic. This yields most of the benefit with minimal complexity.

Always Cache Stable Prompts: Yes – if you have a consistent system persona/instructions that meet the token minimum, cache it. This is especially true for your use case: the “coach persona” prompt is reused in every conversation, so it should be marked for caching once and reused cheaply thereafter. If the system prompt is relatively short (under 1K tokens), you may not hit the caching threshold – in that case consider whether you can bundle more stable context (e.g. additional examples or guidelines) to exceed the min length and gain caching benefits ￼ ￼. Otherwise, a very short prompt costs so little that caching isn’t critical.

Optimal Structuring: To maximize cache hits, put static content at the beginning of the prompt and mark the end of it with cache_control ￼. Ensure that in every request, the cached sections appear in the same order and with identical text ￼. Keep dynamic data (like user-specific or time-sensitive info) after the cached prefix so it doesn’t break the match ￼. If you have multiple distinct static parts (say, a big tool list and also a big reference document), use multiple cache breakpoints – this way a change in one segment doesn’t invalidate the others. Anthropic recommends avoiding caching anything highly variable (obviously, since a single-token difference means no hit) ￼. In summary: cache the persona and other large constants, leave the changing stuff uncached.

OpenAI – Prompt Caching Capabilities

Automatic Prefix Caching

OpenAI’s prompt caching is fully automatic on supported models – there’s no special parameter to send. As of late 2024, OpenAI enabled an internal caching system for the newer model versions (GPT-4 “o” series and others) ￼ ￼. If you use one of those models, any prompt longer than 1024 tokens will be evaluated for caching ￼. The API will detect the longest prefix of your prompt that it has “recently seen” and reuse the cached computation for that prefix, instead of charging full price every time ￼. This means yes, OpenAI uses automatic prefix matching to save work on repeated contexts. The feature is on by default for models like GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and the newer o1 series (which includes successors to GPT-3.5) ￼ ￼. It does not apply to older models like the original GPT-4 0613 or GPT-3.5 Turbo 2023 versions – those never had caching. So you’ll want to use the latest model endpoints (e.g. gpt-4o-2024-08-06 or later) to get caching benefits.

Prefix Length Requirement: The prompt must have at least 1024 tokens in common with a previous prompt for caching to kick in ￼. That 1024-token threshold is the point at which the system begins to consider caching, and beyond that it works in ~128-token increments ￼. In practical terms, the first 1024 tokens of your prompt won’t be cached on a first run (similar to Anthropic’s minimum). But if you send another request with an identical 1024+ token prefix, the portion beyond 1024 can be served from cache (and subsequent calls can extend the cached span further). The prefix match must be exact – character-for-character equivalence in the token sequence. Even small differences (an extra space, a different formatting of a tool definition, etc.) will break the cache alignment. So, much like Anthropic, you need 100% identical static prefixes to get a cache hit ￼. Typically this means your system message and any initial context or instructions should remain literally unchanged across requests. (The caching logic considers the prompt as a whole string of tokens starting from the first token; if token #1 or #50 changes, then the “prefix” common with prior prompts effectively starts after the change, so you may lose most caching.)

No Manual Controls: There is currently no explicit API parameter to control caching in OpenAI’s Chat Completions API – it’s entirely managed by the platform. You cannot force a cache flush or pin content in cache longer, nor can you opt out (except perhaps via a special header for data governance) ￼. The system decides what to cache and for how long. The only visibility you have is through the response usage metrics: the API returns a cached_tokens count in the usage field when a cache is used ￼ ￼. For example, you might see "prompt_tokens": 2006 and "cached_tokens": 1920 indicating that 1920 tokens were pulled from cache (billed at discount) while the rest were new ￼ ￼. There’s also no official way to “preload” a cache or reference a cached content by ID – you always send the full prompt. (The upcoming Assistants API does change the paradigm by storing conversation state, but that’s a layer above prompt caching – more on this below.)

Alternatives and New Features

Assistants API: OpenAI’s Assistants API (v2) is a newer interface that “removes the need to manage conversation history” ￼ by letting you create a session (assistant) that retains context across calls. From a caching perspective, this means you don’t have to resend the entire prompt every time – the system knows the conversation state. This can be seen as a form of server-side caching/persistence of context. In practice, using the Assistants API might reduce token usage since you send only new user input each turn (the model still processes the context from memory, but you aren’t copying it over the wire repeatedly). However, under the hood OpenAI likely still charges for those context tokens (unless they optimize it with the same prompt caching logic). The Assistants API doesn’t explicitly advertise cost savings beyond what prompt caching already provides, but it makes implementation easier. You might use it to maintain your coach persona and chat history implicitly, rather than reconstructing the prompt each time. That said, if you stick with raw Chat Completion calls from the device, there’s no other “knob” to turn – just rely on the automatic caching.

New Model Differences: The caching behavior is uniform across the models that support it (GPT-4o, 4o-mini, o1, etc.) ￼ – all give a ~50% discount on cached tokens ￼ ￼. GPT-4 Turbo (the 0613/1106 versions) did not have caching at launch, and neither did 3.5-turbo. But OpenAI’s newer GPT-4o models effectively replaced “Turbo” with a more cost-efficient architecture that includes caching and lower pricing. So the key difference is: if you use older endpoints, you pay full price for repeated content every time; if you use the newer ones, you automatically save on repeated prefixes. There isn’t (currently) a scenario where one OpenAI model has a different caching algorithm than another – it’s either the feature is on (for the new models) or off (for legacy models). In summary: use GPT-4o or later to get caching; don’t expect caching on the older GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 unless you migrate.

Optimization Strategies

Efficient Conversation Context: The primary strategy with OpenAI is to structure your prompts predictably and reuse initial context. Because the caching kicks in on identical prefixes, you should always send the conversation history in the same order and format each time. For example, always begin with the same system message (your persona/instructions), then include messages in chronological order. This ensures that as the chat grows, the portion representing earlier turns remains a stable prefix. OpenAI specifically advises to “front-load static content” – put unchanging instructions or background at the start of the messages list ￼. In your use case, that means the system role with the coach persona and any general guidelines should be the first message and never change between turns. Then follow with the conversation messages (user and assistant) from previous turns, and finally the new user query. With this approach, each new API call shares a large prefix (all prior messages) with the previous call, yielding a cache hit for that portion.

Patterns for More Cache Hits: If you have use cases beyond straight chat (like many independent queries that share a common prompt prefix), try to batch those queries close in time. OpenAI’s cache entries last on the order of minutes (they note 5–10 minutes of inactivity, potentially up to an hour off-peak) ￼. So, for example, if you need to ask a series of questions each with the same 2K-token background, hitting them sequentially will allow the later ones to reuse the cached prefix from the first. If instead you wait an hour between calls, that prefix might have aged out and will be reprocessed (no hit). Also, ensure the prefix is exactly the same – even something like an extra newline or a randomized ID in the prompt will sabotage the match. Using consistent templates for your prompts can help ￼. Some developers even programmatically verify that the string of system+context is identical across calls.

Message Ordering: The order of messages obviously matters – the caching logic works on the contiguous prefix from the start of the prompt. If you were to prepend dynamic content before the static instructions (for instance, putting user-specific data at the very top), that would ruin the cache utility because the very first tokens would change each time. Always put the static instructions first and dynamic details later. Another consideration is whether to include the assistant’s previous answer in the prompt (OpenAI’s format requires you do, to maintain context). That assistant answer text becomes part of the prefix for the next request. It will match exactly what the model produced earlier, so it will be cached on the next call as well. In other words, by including the full chat history each time, you naturally benefit from caching on all earlier turns. The only caution is if your conversation is extremely lengthy, you might consider truncating or summarizing old turns for efficiency – but at 5–10 messages (~300-400 tokens) this isn’t necessary for you. Keep the messages verbatim to maximize exact prefix matches.

Google Gemini – Context Caching

Context Caching API Overview

Google’s Gemini API supports context caching in two forms: explicit caching (developer-managed) and implicit caching (automatic, similar to the others) ￼. Google actually introduced explicit prompt caching back in May 2024 (before OpenAI/Anthropic did) and later rolled out implicit caching for the newest models in May 2025 ￼ ￼.
	•	Implicit Caching: As of May 8, 2025, all Gemini 2.5 models have implicit caching enabled by default ￼. This means if you send repeated prompts with a common prefix, the service will detect it and automatically apply a discount (and latency improvement) for the reused tokens – no extra work needed. Implicit caching on Gemini works almost identically to OpenAI’s: you need a minimum prefix of 1024 tokens on Gemini 2.5 Flash (and 2048 tokens on 2.5 Pro) before it can cache ￼. If that threshold is met and your new request’s beginning matches a previous request’s beginning, you get a cache hit with a 75% cost discount on those tokens ￼ ￼. The cached content lifetime is on the order of minutes (not officially stated per call, but it’s ephemeral – likely similar 5-60 min range). Google notes that implicit cache has “no cost saving guarantee” ￼ – meaning it’s opportunistic. In practice, you’ll see savings in your usage metadata (cachedContentTokenCount) if it hit ￼ ￼. There’s no user control over implicit caching aside from structuring your prompt: keep the large, repetitive content at the start and unchanged, and reuse it quickly, to maximize hits ￼.
	•	Explicit Caching: Gemini’s explicit caching is a more developer-driven approach that lets you store prompt content on the server and reference it later, rather than resending it each time ￼. You actually create a cache entry via an API call, get back a cache ID (a resource name like projects/.../locations/.../cachedContents/XYZ), and then in subsequent prompt requests you refer to that cached content instead of including the raw text. Under the hood, this caches the token embedding of that content. The benefit: you guarantee cost savings (the cached tokens will be billed at the reduced rate whenever used) regardless of time or minor format differences, as long as you reference the same cache ID. Explicit caches have a configurable Time-to-Live (TTL) – default 60 minutes, but you can set it shorter or longer as needed ￼ ￼. (No hard max TTL is enforced; you could keep it for days if willing to pay storage fees.) This approach is somewhat analogous to Anthropic’s cache_control but more powerful since you don’t need to transmit the content after caching – you just send a reference.

Supported Models: Context caching (explicit or implicit) is supported on most production Gemini models. Currently Gemini 2.5 (Flash, Flash-Lite, Pro) and Gemini 2.0 Flash/Flash-Lite support caching ￼. Earlier 1.5 models had explicit caching available as a beta (some dev guides show 1.5 Flash usage ￼), but note that 1.5 has been deprecated for new projects ￼. Your codebase mentions “Gemini 2.5 Pro, 2.5 Flash, 2.5 Flash Thinking” – these correspond to the supported models (Flash vs Pro being speed vs quality tiers, and possibly a special mode for “Thinking” i.e. chain-of-thought). All those 2.5 variants will do implicit caching automatically, and can use explicit caching as well if needed.

Implementation Details (Explicit Caching)

To use explicit caching on Gemini, you’ll interact with the Vertex AI API’s Cache service. The flow is:
	1.	Create a Cache: Call the cachedContents create endpoint with your content. For example, an HTTP POST to:
POST https://<REGION>-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/<LOCATION>/cachedContents
with a JSON body like:

{
  "displayName": "coach-persona-cache",
  "model": "projects/<PROJECT_ID>/locations/<LOCATION>/publishers/google/models/gemini-2.5-flash",
  "contents": [
    { "role": "system", "parts": [ { "text": "<persona or large content here>" } ] }
  ],
  "ttl": "3600s"
}

This will cache the given content (here a system message) for 1 hour ￼ ￼. The response will include a name field which is the cache resource ID (e.g. projects/123/locations/us-central1/cachedContents/456) ￼.

	2.	Use the Cache in Generation: When calling the model to generate content (e.g. via generateText or generateMessage endpoint), you include the cached content by reference instead of raw text. In the JSON request, you provide the cache resource’s name in a special field (or as part of the prompt structure). For instance, a prompt payload might look like:

{
  "model": "projects/<PID>/locations/<LOC>/publishers/google/models/gemini-2.5-flash",
  "prompt": {
    "context": "projects/<PID>/locations/<LOC>/cachedContents/456",
    "messages": [ { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, I need some advice..." } ]
  }
}

Here, instead of putting the entire persona text in the prompt, we just put a reference to the cached context ￼. The model will pull in those cached tokens as if they were prepended to the prompt. You can even reference multiple caches in one request (e.g. an array of cache IDs) if you have separate chunks, though usually one is enough.

	3.	Managing the Cache: You can extend the TTL via an update call if the conversation lasts longer than expected ￼, or delete the cache when done to stop incurring storage costs ￼. There are also API methods to list or get info on caches (e.g., you might track cacheHitCount or size) ￼. In practice, for a client-side app, you might not bother deleting since a 60-minute TTL will auto-expire, but it’s good to clean up if you create many caches.

Cache Size and Limits: Minimum size for caching is the same as implicit: ~1024 tokens for Flash (and 2048 for Pro) ￼ ￼. Maximum size is just the model’s max input length (e.g. you could cache 30k tokens on a model that supports it – and indeed Google highlights use cases like “cache a 100-page document once, then ask questions about it repeatedly”). There are no special rate limits for cache operations beyond normal Vertex AI rate limits ￼. One important note: cached tokens still count toward the model’s input length on each use ￼. The model doesn’t treat them differently during inference, it just doesn’t charge you full price for them. So you can’t, say, cache 100k of text and then still provide another 100k of new text if the model’s limit is 100k – you’d be over the context window. Keep that in mind if you plan to stuff a lot into the cache.

Updating vs New Cache: You cannot modify the content of an existing cache entry (it’s read-only once created). If the underlying content needs to change, you’d have to create a new cache. (For example, if your “persona” context evolves, you’d cache a fresh version.) You can update the TTL as mentioned, but not the content itself ￼. So generally you’ll create caches for truly static content. In a conversation, you wouldn’t update the same cache with new user messages; instead you’d rely on implicit caching for the evolving turns, or create additional caches if there’s a new large static chunk introduced.

Cost Structure

Pricing Model: Google’s caching pricing has two components: cache storage and cached token usage ￼ ￼. Storing tokens in the cache incurs a small cost per token per hour (so longer TTL or larger content => higher storage cost) ￼. When you use cached tokens in a prompt, those tokens are billed at a 75% discount compared to normal input tokens ￼ ￼. In other words, you pay only 25% of the regular price for each cached token that is used, which is a substantial cost reduction (Anthropic is 10%, OpenAI 50% for comparison). The first time you create the cache, you still pay the full input cost for those tokens (similar to others) ￼. So there is an upfront cost + ongoing storage cost, and then discounted reuse. Google’s docs phrase it as: the initial call that caches content is charged normally, subsequent calls that reference it are charged at the reduced rate ￼.

Break-even Analysis: Thanks to the 0.25× billing on cached tokens, it usually only takes 2 or more uses of a cached context to start saving money. For example, suppose your persona prompt is 4000 tokens. Without caching, calling it twice costs 8000 tokens worth. With caching: first time 4000 tokens at full price, plus perhaps a negligible storage fee for a brief interval, second time 4000 tokens at 25% price = total 4000 + 1000 = 5000 tokens worth (plus tiny storage) – a clear win (~37% savings by the second use). With each additional use in that hour, you save more, approaching 75% savings if you re-use it many times. Google claims up to 75% cost reduction on repetitive context ￼ ￼, which aligns with that per-token discount (the remaining 25% covers their compute overhead to retrieve cached embeddings, etc.). The storage cost is generally small unless you keep huge contexts cached for long periods. For example, if you cached 10k tokens for 1 hour, that’s 10k * (rate per token-hour). The exact pricing is on Google’s site ￼, but it’s minor compared to token processing costs unless you cache enormous data for days.

Additional Costs or Limits: There are no extra fees beyond the above. Using the cache doesn’t count differently against your quota – cached calls still count as normal requests in terms of QPS or monthly token limits. One thing to be mindful of: Provisioned Throughput (if you use Google’s dedicated capacity) currently doesn’t fully support caching in some modes ￼. But that’s likely not relevant for an iOS app. In summary, you pay: (a) full price for initial caching call, (b) 25% price for cached tokens on each reuse, (c) a small hourly charge while the cache exists. No hidden gotchas beyond that.

Cross-Provider Comparison

Cost-Effectiveness: In terms of pure savings on repeated tokens, Anthropic offers the deepest discount (90% off cached tokens) ￼, Google is next (75% off) ￼, and OpenAI is 50% off ￼. However, the providers’ base prices differ as well: OpenAI’s newer models are significantly cheaper per token than Claude 4, for example, so the absolute cost may still favor OpenAI in some cases. With Anthropic, you pay a premium on the first use (125% or 200% of token cost) ￼ but then very little on reuse. Google’s first use is normal cost but adds a small storage fee. In practice, all three can dramatically cut costs for large, repetitive prompts – roughly speaking you might see 50%+ reduction in overall prompt costs if you utilize caching heavily. One difference: Anthropic and Google (explicit) caching can yield higher savings than OpenAI if you reuse context many times (since 0.1× or 0.25× costs are very low). For a single reuse, the savings are more modest (e.g. two calls with Anthropic 5-min cache might save ~30% vs no cache, OpenAI saves 25%, Google saves ~37%). If your use case involves reusing context many times (like a long document across many queries), Anthropic or Google’s explicit cache maximize savings. If it’s just about not resending a persona across a few back-and-forth turns, all three will help, with OpenAI’s 50% being the floor of savings.

Developer Experience: OpenAI is the most hands-off – caching “just happens” behind the scenes, so you simply continue using the API as normal (ensuring you send the full context each time). This means minimal code changes, but also less control. Anthropic’s approach requires a one-time addition of cache_control in your prompt JSON, which is pretty straightforward and gives you explicit markers for cached sections ￼ ￼. It’s a small tweak to your API requests and then it works automatically. Google’s explicit caching is the most involved: you have to manage cache objects via separate API calls and handle their IDs. This is more work, especially from a client-side app – e.g. you’d need to call the cache create endpoint (which might not be simple from iOS due to needing service account credentials or API keys with proper scopes), store the cache name, and then include it in subsequent calls. It might also complicate streaming a bit (though you can still stream responses when using a cache reference). Implicit caching on Google 2.5 is as easy as OpenAI – just send the same prompt and it will quietly apply the discount – but implicit only triggers for large prompts and within short time windows. In summary, for ease of use: OpenAI ≈ Google implicit > Anthropic > Google explicit. For control and flexibility: Google explicit lets you cache arbitrarily long and long-lived contexts, which the others can’t do (Anthropic max 1h, OpenAI not user-controlled).

Cache Duration & Reliability: Anthropic’s ephemeral cache lasts 5 minutes by default ￼ (refreshing on each use), or 1 hour with opt-in ￼. OpenAI’s cache is ephemeral and not explicitly documented, but generally a cached prefix remains hot for at least a few minutes (5–10) and sometimes up to an hour during low load ￼. In both cases, you’re not guaranteed a hit beyond those times – if you wait too long, you pay full price again. Google’s implicit cache is similar (short-lived, though they don’t state exactly). Google’s explicit cache is the outlier: you set the TTL, so it can be as persistent as you need (minutes, hours, even days) ￼. That makes it more reliable for long-running sessions or periodic reuse of the same context over a day. Additionally, explicit cache hits are guaranteed if you reference the cache ID – even if something in the content would normally differ. For example, say you cached a large PDF and then you enable some option in the API that would normally alter how the prompt is processed – if you use the cache ID, those tokens are drawn exactly as stored. With implicit caching (or Anthropic’s), any tiny change or toggle can invalidate the cache. So explicit caching is more robust to changes in surrounding prompt structure. Also, explicit caching avoids issues like accidentally missing a newline – since you’re not re-sending the text, you can’t accidentally alter it and break the match.

In terms of cache misses/gotchas: All providers require careful management of what you change. Anthropic has a detailed table of what invalidates cache (e.g. adding an image in the prompt will break the cache for the messages portion) ￼. OpenAI and Google implicit essentially require an exact prefix match. So, if your app or user can introduce variations, you might not always hit the cache even if you think you would. For example, if you include a timestamp or a random session ID in the system prompt, that defeats caching. Or if on one turn your user’s name is included in the prompt and on another it isn’t, etc. It’s important to isolate truly constant parts. Another edge case: If you alternate between two very different contexts frequently (A, B, A, B), the caches might evict each other or expire, leading to fewer hits. The OpenAI community has noted that you can’t expect every other call to always hit if you’re swapping prefixes, because the system might not hold both long enough ￼. Google’s reddit community also observed that implicit caching could sometimes lead to a model response carrying over behavior unexpectedly (a user reported a deleted system instruction seemingly still affecting the next reply – likely due to caching) ￼. The lesson is to be mindful when caching across turns – ensure that if you truly want something gone, you might need to force a change to break the cache. Overall, reliability is high if used correctly, but these nuances exist.

Unified Abstraction: It is possible to design your prompt handling to work across all three providers in a similar way: namely, always send a full prompt with a stable system message at the top and the conversation/history after. This generic approach leverages OpenAI and Google implicit caching automatically, and for Anthropic you’d simply include the cache_control markers in the appropriate places (they’ll be ignored by OpenAI/Google since those fields are specific to Claude’s API). The content of the persona instructions can be the same text for all. So yes, you can have a unified prompt structure that yields cost savings on each platform. The main divergence is if you choose to use Google’s explicit caching for more efficiency – that would require separate code paths (one to create caches and use cache IDs when on Google). If maximum optimization is desired, a bit of provider-specific logic is worth it. But if simplicity is more important, you might stick to the generic approach of resending everything each time and rely on implicit/prefix caching.

Cache Duration Differences: Summarizing: Anthropic up to 1 hour (with refresh) ￼, OpenAI typically short (let’s say ~10 minutes unless reused) ￼, Google explicit up to whatever TTL you set (with 60 min default) ￼, Google implicit similar short window. In a long-lived mobile app scenario, if a user picks up a conversation hours later, only Google’s explicit cache would still have the context (if you set TTL long enough). Otherwise you’d be re-sending it and paying again (which might be fine if it’s a new session).

Code Integration Examples

To illustrate how to implement caching for each provider, here are example HTTP requests in JSON:
	•	Anthropic (Claude) – Messages API request with caching:

POST /v1/messages HTTP/1.1
Host: api.anthropic.com
Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
Anthropic-Version: 2023-06-01

{
  "model": "claude-4-sonnet", 
  "max_tokens": 1024,
  "system": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "You are a health and fitness coach AI..." 
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "<Long stable persona or knowledge text>",
      "cache_control": { "type": "ephemeral" }
    }
  ],
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Hi, I walked 5000 steps today, any feedback?" }
  ]
}

Explanation: The second system block is marked with cache_control as ephemeral ￼. Claude will cache that content (if >1024 tokens) on this request. Subsequent requests should include the same system array blocks (with the cache marker on the same block) and just new user messages; the response JSON will show cache_read_input_tokens in usage indicating a cache hit ￼. (Note: Ensure calls are within 5 minutes of each other unless using the extended TTL header for 1h.)

	•	OpenAI – Chat Completion with automatic caching:

POST /v1/chat/completions HTTP/1.1
Host: api.openai.com
Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a health coach AI assistant..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I walked 5000 steps today."}
  ],
  "stream": true
}

Explanation: There is no special field for caching – we just send the full conversation (in this initial example, just one user message) each time. The key is to keep using the same system prompt content and include prior messages on each new request. If the combined prompt exceeds 1024 tokens and matches a previous prefix, the OpenAI API will apply caching automatically ￼. In the response, look at the usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens field to see how many tokens were cached ￼ ￼. We also set stream: true since you use streaming; cached prompts work fine with streaming. OpenAI will simply start the stream faster if a lot of tokens were cached (latency is reduced).
Tip: If you use the Assistants API, the request might look different (you’d reference an assistant ID and just send new user input), but under the hood OpenAI manages the context (likely still leveraging caching). The above example is for the standard Chat Completions endpoint, which is what you’d use with URLSession from iOS.

	•	Google Gemini – using explicit context cache and streaming:
First, create a cache for the persona instructions:

POST https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/cachedContents?key=YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "displayName": "coachPersona",
  "model": "projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/gemini-2.5-pro",
  "contents": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "parts": [ { "text": "You are a health coach AI assistant..." } ]
    }
  ],
  "ttl": "3600s"
}

This returns JSON containing "name": "projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/cachedContents/CACHE_ID" (plus usage metadata) ￼ ￼.
Next, use the cached content in a generation request:

POST https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateMessage?key=YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "prompt": {
    "context": "projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/cachedContents/CACHE_ID",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "I walked 5000 steps today, any advice?" }
    ]
  },
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "stream": true
}

Explanation: In the prompt, we set the context to the cache resource name ￼ ￼. That tells Gemini to prepend the cached persona text. We then include the new user message. The model will respond as if it saw the system persona followed by the user query. The billing for this request will count the persona tokens at 25% cost (and show cachedContentTokenCount in the response’s metadata.usage field indicating how many tokens came from cache) ￼ ￼. We also requested streaming ("stream": true) – the streaming API is compatible with cached contexts (the response begins once the model finishes processing, which is faster when using cache).
If you opt not to use explicit caching, you can simply send the full system message + user message in each request (similar to OpenAI’s style). On Gemini 2.5, the repeated system message would then be implicitly cached with 75% savings ￼ ￼. The explicit method is more efficient if you’re frequently reusing large context or using models that support explicit caching but not implicit (like 2.0 Flash).

Error Handling and Monitoring

Cache-Specific Errors: Generally, cache features do not introduce many new error types. Anthropic’s API will ignore a cache_control on a too-short prompt (it just won’t cache) – this isn’t an error, just something to check in the usage fields (no cache tokens). If you misuse the cache_control syntax (e.g. put it in an unsupported place), the API might throw a validation error. In OpenAI’s case, since you don’t control caching, you won’t see caching errors – at most, you might see no cached_tokens in usage if a cache didn’t hit. Google’s explicit cache endpoints can return errors if, say, your content is too large or TTL is invalid. For example, if you try to cache content exceeding the model’s max length, you’ll get a 400 error. Also, if the cache service is used with the wrong region or your API key doesn’t have permission, you’d get errors on creation. Ensure you’re using the same region for cache and model (e.g., us-central1).

Cache Misses: A common scenario is you expected a cache hit but didn’t get one. There’s no “cache miss” error per se, you just see in usage that cached tokens = 0 and you’re charged full cost. Handling this is often about monitoring rather than reacting in real-time. For Anthropic/Google explicit, you can programmatically inspect the response usage: Claude returns cache_read_input_tokens and cache_creation_input_tokens in the response ￼ ￼. If cache_read_input_tokens is 0 when you expected some, it was a miss – you might log that and investigate (was the content slightly different? did TTL expire?). With OpenAI, check cached_tokens in prompt_tokens_details; if it’s absent or 0, that request didn’t use cache. In a live app, you typically wouldn’t retry on a cache miss (the model still processed the request fine); the miss just means cost was higher. But if you notice frequent misses where you expect hits, that’s a sign something in your prompt structure isn’t consistent.

Invalidation Handling: If cached content becomes outdated or invalid (e.g., perhaps your persona instructions changed), you should intentionally invalidate. On Anthropic, you could simply not mark the updated prompt with cache_control (treat it as new content) or change some token so it doesn’t match the old cache (ensuring a fresh processing). On Google explicit, you’d call the delete cache endpoint to remove the old cache, then create a new one with the updated content (or just let TTL expire and then create anew). The system won’t automatically refresh a cache’s content if you start sending a different prompt – it will treat it as a different prefix entirely. So “cache invalidation” is mostly manual: you either let it expire or you deliberately stop using it when stale.

Fallback Strategies: In the rare event a caching service is unavailable or errors out, your code should be ready to fall back to the full prompt. For example, if a Gemini cache creation API call fails, you might decide to proceed by sending the whole content in the prompt (incurring cost but ensuring functionality). Similarly, if for some reason Anthropic’s cache header isn’t recognized, Claude will just process normally. Always ensure the conversation can continue even if caching doesn’t engage – the only difference will be a bit more latency or cost.

Monitoring Cache Performance: It’s highly recommended to track how often your caches are hitting. Each provider surfaces metrics:
	•	Anthropic: Check the usage object in responses. It includes cache_read_input_tokens (tokens retrieved from cache) and cache_creation_input_tokens (tokens newly cached) ￼. You can log these. For instance, if cache_read_input_tokens is large on most requests, you know caching is working well. If cache_creation_input_tokens keeps showing up repeatedly, it might mean your cache is getting invalidated frequently (e.g., you see a new cache entry being made each time – not ideal).
	•	OpenAI: The usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens tells how many tokens were cached ￼. You can compute the percentage of prompt tokens that were cached. OpenAI also gives no direct API to query caches (since it’s internal), so this per-request info is key. If you aggregate this, you can monitor your cache hit rate over time (e.g., “we saved X tokens out of Y total this week via caching”).
	•	Google: For implicit caching, you’ll see cachedContentTokenCount in the metadata of the response ￼. For explicit caching, you can call the Vertex API to get cache usage info – e.g., the cache resource has fields like how many times it was used, how many tokens served. In Vertex AI’s tooling, a cache is a first-class object, so you can list caches and see their stats. In code, after a conversation, you might call GET /cachedContents/CACHE_ID to see usageMetadata (which includes token counts, etc.) ￼. This can inform you if a cache was worth it (e.g., if a cache was created but only used once, you paid extra for no reason – maybe next time don’t cache that).

Important metrics to monitor across the board: cache hit rate (what fraction of requests or tokens benefited from cache), latency improvements (time saved per request when cache hits vs misses), and cost savings (you can estimate dollars saved by comparing effective token usage with and without cache). Early on, you might log these to fine-tune your approach (for example, if you see that caching conversation history beyond the first message yields negligible hits, you might simplify and only cache the persona). All three providers essentially encourage watching these usage numbers to optimize how you use caching ￼ ￼.

Recommended Strategy for the Fitness Coach Use Case

Given your app’s profile – a consistent coach persona, dynamic health data inputs, and 5–10 message conversations with streaming – here’s how to maximize caching benefits:

1. Cache the Persona, Send Dynamic Data Uncached: The coach’s persona and instructions (which likely include the coaching style, tone, maybe some fixed guidelines) should be treated as a static context. That content often doesn’t change per user or session (or changes very rarely). This is the ideal chunk to cache. You can prepend it as a system message (for OpenAI/Gemini) or the first system content block (for Anthropic) and mark/reference it for caching ￼ ￼. By contrast, the user’s health data – daily steps, sleep, workout stats – are inherently dynamic and should not be cached as part of the static prefix. Include those details in the user’s message or as a separate system message after the cached section. For example, you might have: System message = persona (cached), then another system message or just part of user prompt = “Today’s data: 5000 steps, 7 hours sleep…” (not cached). This way, each request sees the same persona prefix (cache hit) but can freely update the latest data without invalidating that cache ￼. In practice: on Claude, you’d put the dynamic data in a new message after the cache_control block; on OpenAI, you might incorporate the data into the user’s prompt each turn; on Gemini, just don’t bake the dynamic text into the cached content – send it normally.

2. Prompt Restructuring: Leverage segmentation to maximize cache hits. If your persona plus some general instructions are, say, 800 tokens, consider expanding them with a few example Q&A pairs or more detailed instructions to push above 1024 tokens (so caching can activate) ￼. It might feel counterintuitive to add tokens for cost reasons, but a one-time addition of 300 tokens that then gets cached (at 10% or 25% cost on reuse) can pay off if it unlocks caching. Also, structure the messages such that the persona stands alone as a big first block. Any other less stable prompt elements (like a brief welcome message or session-specific note) could be a second block without cache. For instance, you could have: system persona (cached), then a system message like “You have the latest user health metrics available.” If that second part changes or not needed later, it won’t disturb the cached persona. Essentially, isolate the largest stable context into its own cached message ￼. Another restructuring tip: if you have long conversation histories, consider whether you need to send the entire history every time. At 5–10 messages (~300-400 tokens total), it’s fine to send all for completeness (and those will get cached incrementally as the conversation grows). But if the conversation were to grow much longer, you might truncate or summarize older turns. This is more about token optimization than caching per se, but it complements caching: shorter prompts are cheaper and faster, and caching handles the large persona part.

3. Generic vs Provider-Specific Optimizations: Since your app dynamically switches providers, it’s wise to implement a baseline solution that works for all, then layer provider-specific tweaks on top if needed. The baseline: always include the coach persona text at the start of each prompt (ensuring it’s identical each time). This alone lets OpenAI and Gemini 2.5 do their thing without extra work, and for Anthropic you simply add the cache_control flag to that content ￼. This unified approach yields significant savings across the board. Now, provider-specific enhancements: for Anthropic, definitely use the cache_control parameter – otherwise Claude won’t cache at all. For Google, decide if you want to integrate explicit caching. If your persona context is moderately sized (a few hundred tokens) and your conversations are short-lived, the overhead of explicit caching might outweigh benefits – implicit caching could suffice. But if the persona or other context is large (say you load a FAQ document or a long diet plan as context), using explicit caching is worth it to guarantee the 75% discount and avoid resending that data from the device each time ￼ ￼. Implementing explicit cache from an iOS client is feasible but involves an extra API call and storing the cache ID. You could implement it such that when a user starts a session with Gemini, you call the cache create endpoint for the persona, store the ID in app state, and then include that in subsequent requests. If that feels too heavy, you might skip it and trust implicit caching (just know you’ll re-upload the persona text each time, costing bandwidth).

In summary, start with: Claude – use cache_control on persona; OpenAI – just send persona in system message; Gemini – send persona normally (2.5 will implicitly cache it). Then, if you observe high token usage on Gemini or want maximum savings, implement the explicit cache flow for Gemini. This way, you’re not over-complicating initial development, but you have the option to optimize further per provider.

4. Conversation History Caching: It’s usually not necessary to cache the entire conversation history explicitly. Each new user query naturally includes the past messages (for context), which for OpenAI/Gemini implicit means those past messages become a cached prefix automatically on the next call, and for Anthropic you can mark them incrementally if desired ￼ ￼. But explicitly managing cache for every turn is overkill. A good pattern is: cache the big static things (tools, persona, any lengthy docs), and let the evolving chat be handled by the model’s normal mechanism. The earlier messages will still benefit from caching on subsequent turns as they move into the prefix. For example, by turn 5 of the conversation, turns 1-4 are a stable prefix. OpenAI will likely be caching most of those tokens (50% off) without you doing anything special. Anthropic will also reuse them as long as they were identical (Anthropic even notes that assistant “thinking” or tool-output blocks from prior turns can get cached implicitly when reused in context) ￼ ￼. So you don’t need to individually mark each user message with cache_control – if you leave the system persona cached, that’s often enough, since the biggest cost (the large persona or docs) is handled, and the variable dialogue is comparatively small. Only if you had extremely long conversations (hundreds of turns) or very verbose assistant answers might it be worth caching conversation segments (to avoid re-processing a huge transcript). With 5–10 short messages, the overhead is minimal and normal prefix caching will cover it. In your case, focus on caching the persona instructions and any other stable context (like maybe a standard set of tips or definitions the coach uses). The user’s health data and the latest Q&A should just flow normally each turn.

Cost Comparison Table

To summarize the cost implications, here’s a high-level comparison of caching costs across providers (for input tokens):

Provider	Uncached Input Tokens Cost	Cached Input Tokens Cost (read)	Cache Write/Storage Overhead	Cache Duration (default)
Anthropic Claude	1× base rate (e.g. $15/MTok for Claude 4 Opus) ￼	0.1× base (90% off) ￼	1.25× base for 5-min cache write (2× for 1h) ￼. No storage fee beyond token cost.	5 minutes (extendable to 1 hour with beta) ￼ ￼
OpenAI GPT-4o/Turbo	1× base rate (e.g. $2.50/MTok for GPT-4o) ￼ ￼	0.5× base (50% off) ￼ ￼	No explicit write cost (first use is just normal cost). No storage fee (ephemeral in-memory).	~5–10 minutes (ephemeral; managed by OpenAI) ￼
Google Gemini	1× base rate (e.g. $10/MTok for 2.5 Pro, hypothetical)	0.25× base (75% off) ￼ ￼	First use normal cost. Storage: billed per token per hour (small fee) ￼. No extra write multiplier, just regular cost + storage.	Implicit: minutes (short-lived) ￼. Explicit: 60 min default TTL (configurable; can extend or refresh) ￼

Notes: Base rates vary by model (the above $/MTok are illustrative). “MTok” = 1 million tokens. Anthropic’s cache read at 0.1× is extremely cheap, but remember you paid 1.25× upfront – so you start saving after ~2 uses. OpenAI’s 0.5× is a flat half-price on any cached portion, so you start saving immediately on second use (no extra initial fee). Google’s 0.25× is very cheap per reuse; with a tiny storage cost, it usually surpasses OpenAI in savings after 2+ uses. All providers still charge full rate for any new tokens in the prompt and for output tokens. Output generation isn’t affected by caching (no cost discount there) ￼.

Conclusion

Prompt/context caching has become a key technique to reduce latency and cost for LLM applications. By caching the stable parts of your prompts – like your coach persona and reference materials – you can save on the order of 50–90% of those tokens’ cost on subsequent interactions, without impacting quality ￼ ￼. All three providers you use support this, albeit in slightly different ways. The bottom line recommendations:
	•	Always reuse your identical system prompts/persona across requests – this unlocks caching on all platforms. For Claude, tag it with cache_control ￼; for others, just ensure it’s the same string every time.
	•	Keep dynamic data separate from cached content – include fresh data (steps count, etc.) in a way that doesn’t alter the cached prefix ￼. This ensures you get cache hits while still personalizing responses with new info.
	•	On client-side, implement minimal caching logic: Add the Anthropic parameter, and consider using Google’s explicit cache if your app often sends large contexts. OpenAI requires no extra code beyond good prompt hygiene.
	•	Monitor usage and adjust: use the token usage metrics to verify you’re getting hits ￼ ￼. If not, tweak the prompt ordering or length until you do.
	•	Maintain quality: caching does not change the model’s output (it’s the same result as if you’d sent the full prompt each time) ￼, so you should not see differences in response quality – only faster and cheaper results for your users.

By following these practices, your fitness coach app can handle conversation continuity efficiently. You’ll significantly reduce redundant token processing (and cost) while maintaining the rich context needed for high-quality coaching responses. Happy caching!
