## ðŸ“‹ Documentation Standards

All documentation should follow these conventions:
- Use UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md for document names
- Include clear headers and table of contents for long documents
- Keep line length under 120 characters for readability
- Use relative links between documents
- Archive completed/outdated docs rather than deleting
