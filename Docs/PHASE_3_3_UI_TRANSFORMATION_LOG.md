## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Per-Screen Validation

- [ ] All UI components properly imported
- [ ] Spacing uses AppSpacing tokens (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
- [ ] Animations use MotionToken constants
- [ ] Glass cards have consistent styling
- [ ] Text uses appropriate fonts from AppFonts
- [ ] Haptic feedback on interactions

### Performance Validation
- [ ] 120fps on iPhone 15 Pro+
- [ ] No frame drops during transitions
- [ ] Memory usage reasonable
- [ ] Blur budget maintained (max 6 per screen)

### Visual Consistency
- [ ] Gradients transition smoothly
- [ ] Glass morphism depth consistent
- [ ] Shadow hierarchy maintained
- [ ] Corner radius standards followed

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with high-impact screens** (Onboarding, Chat)
2. **Test each screen in isolation** before moving on
3. **Use Preview for rapid iteration**
4. **Profile performance early and often**
5. **Document any deviations from standards**

## Technical Decisions Log

### 2025-06-10
- **Decision**: Use AnyShapeStyle for gradient/color type mismatches
- **Reason**: SwiftUI's foregroundStyle needs unified type
- **Impact**: Clean solution, no performance impact

- **Decision**: Create AudioLevelVisualizer instead of VoiceVisualizer
- **Reason**: Name conflict with existing component
- **Impact**: Avoided duplicate type definition

- **Decision**: Add static convenience methods to HapticService
- **Reason**: UI components need quick haptic feedback
- **Impact**: Simpler API for common use cases
