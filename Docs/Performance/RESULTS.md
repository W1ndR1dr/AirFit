# AirFit Performance Validation Results

Date: 2025-09-07  
Branch: claude/T41-perf-capture  
Environment: macOS 26.0, Xcode 26.0 (17A5305f)  
Task: T41 - Real Performance Capture (R06 follow-through)

## Executive Summary

Performance validation framework is complete with signposts integrated throughout the codebase. Build issues prevent full device testing at this time, but the performance infrastructure is ready for measurement once builds succeed.

## Build & Test Status

| Metric | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| XcodeGen | ✅ Success | < 1s |
| SwiftLint | ✅ Success | 4s (with warnings) |
| Build (iOS 26.0) | ❌ Failed | Type mismatches in Dashboard |
| Unit Tests | ❌ Blocked | Build required |
| CI Guards | ✅ 0 CRITICAL | 147 force unwraps eliminated on R02 branch |

## Performance Metrics Framework

### Signpost Implementation Status

✅ **Pipeline Signposts** (`coach.pipeline`)
- Location: `AirFit/Modules/AI/CoachEngine.swift:496-586`
- Stages implemented:
  - `coach.parse` - Message classification
  - `coach.context` - Context assembly  
  - `coach.infer` - AI inference
  - `coach.act` - Action execution

✅ **Streaming Signposts**
- Location: `AirFit/Services/AI/AIService.swift`
- Events implemented:
  - `stream.start` - Stream initiation
  - `stream.first_token` - TTFT measurement
  - `stream.delta` - Token streaming
  - `stream.complete` - Stream completion

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Time to First Token (TTFT) | < 300ms p50 / < 500ms p95 | Ready to measure |
| Context Assembly | < 500ms cold / < 10ms warm | Ready to measure |
| App Launch | < 1.0s | Ready to measure |
| Memory Usage | < 200MB baseline | Ready to measure |
| Battery Impact | < 5% per 30min active | Ready to measure |

## Commands Used

```bash
# Project generation
xcodegen generate

# Build attempt (failed due to type issues)
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer \
  xcodebuild build -scheme AirFit \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro,OS=26.0'

# Performance benchmark script
./Scripts/validation/performance-benchmarks.sh

# CI Guards validation
./Scripts/ci-guards.sh
```

## Performance Measurement Instructions

Once build issues are resolved, capture performance metrics using:

```bash
# 1. Build for profiling
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer \
  xcodebuild build -scheme AirFit \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro,OS=26.0'

# 2. Capture signposts with Instruments
xcrun xctrace record --template "Time Profiler" \
  --device "iPhone 16 Pro" \
  --output perf_t41.trace \
  --time-limit 60s \
  --launch com.airfit.app

# 3. Export signpost data
xcrun xctrace export --input perf_t41.trace \
  --xpath '//signpost[@name="coach.pipeline" or @name="stream.first_token"]' \
  > signpost_results.json

# 4. Analyze TTFT
grep "stream.first_token" signpost_results.json | \
  jq '.duration_ns / 1000000' | \
  sort -n | \
  awk '{a[NR]=$1} END {print "p50:", a[int(NR*0.5)], "p95:", a[int(NR*0.95)]}'
```

## Known Issues

1. **Build Failure**: Type mismatch between `FoodNutritionSummary` and `NutritionSummary`
   - Fixed property name mismatches (calorieGoal vs caloriesTarget)
   - Conversion logic added in DashboardViewModel
   
2. **SwiftLint Warnings**: Custom rules configuration needs update
   - Invalid rules: no_swiftdata_in_ui, no_force_ops, etc.
   - Rules fallback to defaults

## Artifacts

- `performance_validation_t41.log` - Performance benchmark output
- `build_t41.log` - Build attempt log
- `ci-guards-summary.json` - Guard validation results

## Next Steps

1. Resolve remaining build issues in DashboardViewModel
2. Execute full performance test suite on physical device
3. Capture and analyze signpost data for TTFT and context metrics
4. Update results with measured p50/p95 values
