#### Newly Completed (2025-06-06 Evening)

## üö® Critical Discovery: Duplicate Test Files

During test suite validation, discovered that 4 "new" test files were actually duplicates of existing tests:
- ‚ùå AICoachServiceTests.swift - Already existed in Dashboard/Services/ 
- ‚ùå AnalyticsServiceTests.swift - Already existed in Services/Analytics/
- ‚ùå HealthKitServiceTests.swift - Already existed in Dashboard/Services/
- ‚ùå NutritionServiceTests.swift - Already existed in FoodTracking/Services/

**Lesson Learned**: Always use grep/find to check for existing tests before creating new ones. The existing tests were in Services subfolders, not at the module level.

## Remaining Disabled Tests Analysis

The following test files remain disabled and require deeper refactoring:

1. **PersonaSystemIntegrationTests.swift.disabled** - Complex integration test with outdated initialization
2. **PersonaEnginePerformanceTests.swift.disabled** - Performance tests for old persona system
3. **NutritionParsingFinalIntegrationTests.swift.disabled** - Has FoodTrackingViewModel init issues
4. **OnboardingViewTests.swift.disabled** - UI tests with outdated view testing approach
5. **PersonaGenerationStressTests.swift.disabled** - Stress tests for old persona generation
6. **ServicePerformanceTests.swift.disabled** - References deprecated NetworkManager.shared

These tests would require significant refactoring to match current architecture and are lower priority.

## Conclusion

Exceptional progress today in three sessions:

**Morning Session**: Nearly completed all critical priority tasks with 191 new test methods. Created comprehensive HealthKit test coverage, DI infrastructure tests, and discovered/fixed duplicate test files.

**Evening Session**: Fixed test compilation errors, extracted VoiceInputProtocol for better testability, and re-enabled 4 test suites with proper mocking. Added 22 more test methods.

**Late Evening Session**: Systematically fixed remaining compilation errors across 8 test files. Fixed NutritionServiceTests data model issues, MockPersonaService enum/struct issues, and @MainActor isolation in 7 test files.

**Total Progress**: 213 new test methods, 25 files created/updated, 133 compilation errors fixed (from 143 to ~10), and 1 major architectural improvement (VoiceInputProtocol). All test files touched today now compile successfully with proper Swift 6 concurrency. The test suite is now significantly more robust and maintainable. The foundation is solid for achieving the 80%+ coverage target.
