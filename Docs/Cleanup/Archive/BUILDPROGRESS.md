## Root Cause Analysis

### Pattern 1: Missing Types & Protocols
- Recovery system types (RecoveryResult, AlternativeApproach) were never defined
- These appear to be part of an incomplete recovery system implementation

### Pattern 2: API Mismatches
- Methods being called don't match actual implementations
- Suggests incomplete refactoring or API changes

### Pattern 3: Access Control Issues
- Private properties being accessed from outside their scope
- Need to expose necessary properties or provide accessor methods

### Pattern 4: @Observable vs ObservableObject Migration
- Mix of old ObservableObject pattern with new @Observable
- Need consistent migration approach

## Next Actions
1. Fix remaining OnboardingFlowCoordinator issues
2. Address DataManagementView spacing and access issues
3. Fix OnboardingViewModel initialization
4. Resolve DefaultAICoachService API issues
5. Add missing DataManager method
