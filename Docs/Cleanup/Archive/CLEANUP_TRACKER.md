### Optimal Sequencing

**Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 days)**
1. Create missing mock extensions (PersonalityInsights.mock ✅)
2. Fix compilation errors in enabled tests
3. Ensure basic test infrastructure works

**Phase 2: Core Business Logic (2-3 days)**
1. Fix FoodTrackingViewModelTests
   - Refactor to use public APIs only
   - Update mock usage patterns
2. Fix NutritionParsingRegressionTests
   - Critical for preventing nutrition calculation bugs
3. Fix NutritionParsingIntegrationTests
   - Validates end-to-end flow

**Phase 3: Onboarding DI Migration (3-4 days)**
1. Complete onboarding module DI migration
2. Fix OnboardingViewModelTests
3. Fix ConversationViewModelTests
4. Fix PersonaSystemIntegrationTests

**Phase 4: Service Layer (1-2 days)**
1. Fix FoodVoiceAdapterTests
2. Fix ServiceProtocolsTests
3. Add missing service tests for new implementations

### Test Refactoring Patterns

1. **Private API Access**
   ```swift
   // ❌ OLD: Direct private property access
   sut.transcribedText = "test"
   await sut.processTranscription()
   
   // ✅ NEW: Use public callbacks
   mockVoiceAdapter.simulateTranscription("test")
   // processTranscription called automatically via callback
   ```

2. **DI Pattern Updates**
   ```swift
   // ❌ OLD: Direct initialization
   let vm = FoodTrackingViewModel(user: user, coordinator: coordinator)
   
   // ✅ NEW: Full DI
   let vm = FoodTrackingViewModel(
       modelContext: modelContext,
       user: user,
       foodVoiceAdapter: adapter,
       nutritionService: service,
       coachEngine: engine,
       coordinator: coordinator
   )
   ```

3. **Mock Pattern Updates**
   ```swift
   // ❌ OLD: Property-based mocks
   mockService.resultToReturn = value
   
   // ✅ NEW: Method-based mocks with Sendable
   mockService.stub(#function, with: value)
   ```
