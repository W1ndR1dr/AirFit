# Dependency Injection Migration Plan

## Overview
This document defines the strategy for migrating AirFit from singleton-based architecture to modern dependency injection.

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (2025-06-05)
**Completed**: All modules migrated to DI, including complex Onboarding module

## Core Principles

### 1. Pragmatic Approach
- Keep true singletons where appropriate (system resources)
- Don't over-engineer - Swift isn't Java
- Align with SwiftUI patterns (Environment)
- Gradual migration - don't break working code

### 2. What to Include in DI
‚úÖ **INCLUDE**:
- All services with business logic
- ViewModels and their dependencies
- Anything that needs mocking for tests
- User-scoped services (CoachEngine, PersonaEngine)
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, analytics)

### 3. What to Exclude from DI
‚ùå **EXCLUDE** (Keep as Singletons):
- `KeychainWrapper` - True system resource wrapper
- `AppLogger` - Stateless utility, needs global access
- `HapticManager` - UI utility, stateless
- `WhisperKit` - Heavy ML model, must be singleton
- `RoutingConfiguration` - App-wide configuration
- Pure utility extensions (Date+Helpers, String+Helpers)
- SwiftUI Environment values

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Created DIContainer.swift
- Created DIBootstrapper.swift  
- Created DIViewModelFactory.swift
- Created DIExample.swift with patterns

### Phase 2: Module Migration Progress
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - All 6 modules migrated (2025-06-05)

‚úÖ **Completed Modules**:
1. Dashboard - Well-defined boundaries, good example
2. FoodTracking - Complex dependencies, good DI showcase  
3. Chat - Message handling, AI integration
4. Settings - User preferences, configuration
5. Workouts - Exercise tracking, templates
6. Onboarding - Complex flow with coordinator pattern, migrated successfully

**Note**: Notifications module has no ViewModel/View pattern, so DI migration is N/A

### Phase 3: Test Suite Migration
**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS (2025-06-05) - Only 2 test files migrated

**Key Issues**:
- Tests accessing private APIs after refactoring
- Mock pattern mismatches with new DI
- Initialization signature changes
- Protocol vs concrete type expectations

**Migration Steps**:
1. **Test Infrastructure** (Prerequisites)
   - Update mock pattern to support DI (property injection ‚Üí constructor injection)
   - Create test-specific DIContainer configurations
   - Add protocol-based initializers where needed

2. **Core Module Tests** (Priority 1)
   - FoodTrackingViewModelTests: Refactor to use public APIs
   - NutritionParsingRegressionTests: Update initializers
   - Create factory methods for test scenarios

3. **Integration Tests** (Priority 2)
   - Update to use full DI initialization
   - Mock at service boundaries, not internals
   - Test complete flows, not implementation details

4. **Onboarding Tests** (After module migration)
   - Complete onboarding DI migration first
   - Update all onboarding tests together
   - Maintain test coverage during migration
5. Verify functionality

### Phase 3: Module-by-Module Migration ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Order** (easiest to hardest):
1. ‚úÖ Dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Settings
3. ‚úÖ Workouts  
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Notifications (no ViewModel/View pattern - N/A)
5. ‚úÖ Chat
6. ‚úÖ FoodTracking
7. ‚úÖ AI/Onboarding (most complex - completed successfully)

### Phase 4: Service Layer Cleanup ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ ServiceRegistry marked as deprecated (kept for test compatibility)
- ‚úÖ DependencyContainer marked as deprecated (kept for Onboarding compatibility)
- ‚úÖ DIViewModelFactory duplicate makeFoodTrackingViewModel removed
- ‚úÖ Update remaining .shared usage (ExerciseDatabase and WorkoutSyncService now injected via DI)
- ‚úÖ WorkoutViewModel updated to use DI for all dependencies
- ‚úÖ DIBootstrapper and DIViewModelFactory updated to register/inject these services

### Phase 5: Test Migration üöß IN PROGRESS
- ‚úÖ Test compilation errors fixed using automated scripts
- ‚úÖ DITestHelper.createTestContainer() properly implemented with mock registrations
- ‚úÖ Fixed async setUp() issues in test files (converted to setupTest() pattern)
- ‚úÖ Fixed duplicate @MainActor attributes
- ‚úÖ Updated DITestHelper to properly register all mock services
- ‚ùå Replace all MockX.shared patterns (most tests still use old patterns)
- ‚úÖ DIBootstrapper+Test.swift created with createMockContainer for UI testing
- ‚úÖ DITestHelper exists and used by 2 test files (Dashboard, NutritionParsing)
- ‚ùå Remove test pollution between tests
- ‚ùå Improve test speed

## Registration Patterns

### 1. Singleton Services
```swift
// For app-lifetime services
container.register(WeatherServiceProtocol.self, lifetime: .singleton) { _ in
    WeatherService()
}
```

### 2. Transient Services  
```swift
// For per-use services (ViewModels, module services)
container.register(NutritionServiceProtocol.self) { container in
    let modelContext = try await container.resolve(ModelContext.self)
    return NutritionService(modelContext: modelContext)
}
```

### 3. User-Scoped Services
```swift
// Created in ViewModelFactory per-user
let coachEngine = CoachEngine(/* user-specific deps */)
```

### 4. Named Registrations
```swift
// For multiple implementations
container.register(AIServiceProtocol.self, name: "offline") { _ in
    OfflineAIService()
}
```

## Service Categories

### Core Services (Singletons)
- APIKeyManager
- NetworkClient  
- LLMOrchestrator
- WeatherService
- HealthKitManager (via .shared)
- NotificationManager (via .shared)

### Module Services (Transient)
- NutritionService
- WorkoutService
- AnalyticsService
- Module-specific ViewModels

### User-Scoped Services (Factory-Created)
- CoachEngine
- PersonaEngine
- ConversationManager
- AICoachService

### Keep as Singletons (Not in DI)
- KeychainWrapper.shared
- AppLogger.shared
- HapticManager.shared
- DataManager.shared (until refactored)

## ViewModel Patterns

### Before (Singleton Access)
```swift
class DashboardViewModel {
    init() {
        self.apiKeyManager = APIKeyManager.shared
        self.healthKit = HealthKitManager.shared
    }
}
```

### After (Constructor Injection)
```swift
class DashboardViewModel {
    init(
        apiKeyManager: APIKeyManagementProtocol,
        healthKitService: HealthKitService,
        // ... other deps
    ) {
        self.apiKeyManager = apiKeyManager
        self.healthKitService = healthKitService
    }
}
```

## View Patterns

### Before (Manual Creation)
```swift
struct DashboardView: View {
    @State private var viewModel: DashboardViewModel?
    
    var body: some View {
        if let viewModel {
            // content
        } else {
            ProgressView().task {
                // Manual wiring of 6+ dependencies
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### After (DI Factory)
```swift
struct DashboardView: View {
    let user: User
    
    var body: some View {
        DashboardContent()
            .withViewModel { factory in
                try await factory.makeDashboardViewModel(user: user)
            }
    }
}
```

## Testing Patterns

### Before (Singleton Pollution)
```swift
class DashboardTests: XCTestCase {
    override func tearDown() {
        // Complex singleton cleanup
        APIKeyManager.shared.reset()
        // Hope nothing leaked...
    }
}
```

### After (Clean DI)
```swift
class DashboardTests: XCTestCase {
    var container: DIContainer!
    
    override func setUp() {
        container = DIBootstrapper.createTestContainer()
    }
    
    func testSomething() async {
        let factory = DIViewModelFactory(container: container)
        let vm = try await factory.makeDashboardViewModel(user: .mock)
        // Clean, isolated test
    }
}
```

## Special Cases

### 1. ModelContext
- Not Sendable, needs careful handling
- Always use mainContext from ModelContainer
- Pass through DI but access carefully

### 2. @MainActor Services
- HealthKitService, DashboardNutritionService, etc.
- Initialize with `await` in factories
- Keep actor isolation correct

### 3. Heavy Resources
- WhisperKit models - keep singleton
- CoreML models - keep singleton
- Large caches - evaluate case by case

### 4. SwiftUI Previews
```swift
.task {
    let container = try? await DIBootstrapper.createPreviewContainer()
}
.withDIContainer(container)
```

## Migration Checklist

For each module:
- [ ] Identify all dependencies
- [ ] Update ViewModel to constructor injection
- [ ] Create/update factory method in DIViewModelFactory
- [ ] Update View to use .withViewModel
- [ ] Migrate unit tests to use test container
- [ ] Update previews to use preview container
- [ ] Remove singleton access
- [ ] Test thoroughly
- [ ] Document any special cases

## Success Metrics

1. **No more .shared in ViewModels** (except approved list)
2. **All ViewModels created via factory**
3. **Tests run faster and in isolation**
4. **Clear dependency graphs**
5. **Easy to add new implementations**

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't force everything into DI** - Some singletons are fine
2. **Don't create protocols just for DI** - Use concrete types when there's only one implementation
3. **Don't forget @MainActor** - Many services need it
4. **Don't use synchronous resolution** - Always use async/await
5. **Don't register user-specific services globally** - Use factories

## Next Immediate Steps

1. ‚úÖ Fixed build issues with AIServiceProtocol Sendable conformance
2. ‚úÖ Created DI integration for Dashboard
3. ‚úÖ Discovered @Observable incompatibility with withViewModel helper
4. ‚úÖ Migrated all 6 viable modules to DI (AI/Onboarding deferred)
5. ‚úÖ Removed UnifiedOnboardingView and MinimalContentView (cleanup)
6. ‚úÖ Fix mock compilation errors in test suite
7. üöß Migrate tests to use DITestHelper
8. ‚úÖ Marked DependencyContainer as deprecated (kept for Onboarding compatibility)
9. ‚úÖ Marked ServiceRegistry as deprecated (kept for test compatibility)
10. ‚úÖ Removed ServiceLocator pattern from ServiceConfiguration
11. üöß Complete AI/Onboarding migration when ready

## @Observable Migration Pattern

Since ViewModels use the new `@Observable` macro instead of `ObservableObject`, the withViewModel helper doesn't work. Instead, use this pattern:

```swift
struct DashboardView: View {
    let user: User
    @State private var viewModel: DashboardViewModel?
    @Environment(\.diContainer) private var container
    
    var body: some View {
        Group {
            if let viewModel = viewModel {
                DashboardContent(user: user, viewModel: viewModel)
            } else {
                ProgressView()
                    .task {
                        let factory = DIViewModelFactory(container: container)
                        viewModel = try? await factory.makeDashboardViewModel(user: user)
                    }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Questions for Later

1. Should we create a @StateObject wrapper for async ViewModel creation?
2. Should module services be singleton or transient?
3. How to handle deep linking with DI?
4. Preview performance with full DI setup?
