# Codex Analysis Project Summary

## What We've Prepared

I've created a comprehensive analysis plan with 15 Codex agent tasks to deeply understand the AirFit codebase and diagnose the black screen issue.

### Documents Created

1. **`COMPREHENSIVE_CODEBASE_ANALYSIS_PLAN.md`** - The master plan with all 15 agent descriptions
2. **`AGENT_PROMPTS_WAVE1.md`** - Wave 1 prompts (Architecture & Structure)
3. **`AGENT_PROMPTS_WAVE2.md`** - Wave 2 prompts (Features & Business Logic)  
4. **`AGENT_PROMPTS_WAVE3.md`** - Wave 3 prompts (Integration & Advanced)
5. **`CODEX_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md`** - Step-by-step execution instructions

### How to Execute

For each agent:
1. Send `AGENTS.md` content as the system prompt (defines the John Carmack persona)
2. Send the specific analysis prompt from the wave files
3. Have agent output to `Docs/Research Reports/{specified_filename}.md`

### Why This Approach

As you noted:
- "Whatever is currently in your context may be completely incorrect"
- "I think having that deep understanding will help not just with this one issue we're having, but also with any other issue that might come up in the future"

This comprehensive analysis will:
- Provide ground truth about the codebase architecture
- Identify all architectural issues, not just the black screen
- Create documentation for future reference
- Enable confident, definitive fixes instead of band-aids

### Immediate Focus Areas

Based on the black screen issue, pay special attention to:
- **Agent 2**: App Lifecycle Analysis (traces initialization flow)
- **Agent 3**: DI System Analysis (async resolution issues)
- **Agent 4**: Concurrency Model (actor isolation conflicts)
- **Agent 7**: AI System Analysis (demo mode complexity)

### Expected Timeline

- Wave 1 (5 agents): Can run in parallel - ~30-60 minutes
- Wave 2 (5 agents): Can start after Wave 1 - ~30-60 minutes
- Wave 3 (5 agents): Can run independently - ~30-60 minutes
- Synthesis: After all complete - ~30 minutes

Total: 2-4 hours for complete analysis

### Next Steps

1. Execute Wave 1 agents (focus on architecture)
2. Review findings for black screen root cause
3. Execute remaining waves for comprehensive understanding
4. Synthesize findings into actionable plan
5. Implement definitive fixes with confidence

This approach ensures we understand the codebase thoroughly before making any more changes, avoiding the "simple fix hell" you mentioned.
