  - AirFit/Services/Health/HealthKitManager.swift:400-427
  - AirFit/Core/Protocols/HealthKitManagerProtocol.swift:15

  Changes Made:
  // BEFORE: Placeholder data
  let workoutCount = 3
  let totalCalories = 1500.0 // Placeholder

  // AFTER: Real HealthKit data
  let workoutData = await healthKitManager.getWorkoutData(from: startDate, to: endDate)
  let exerciseSeconds = await healthKitManager.getExerciseMinutes(from: startDate, to: endDate)

  New Methods Added:
  - HealthKitManager.getExerciseMinutes(from:to:) -> TimeInterval

  Changes Made:
  // BEFORE: SwiftData only
  private func hasWorkoutToday() -> Bool {
      return user.workouts.contains { /* SwiftData check */ }
  }

  // AFTER: Comprehensive detection
  private func hasWorkoutToday() async -> Bool {
      // Check SwiftData first (AirFit workouts)
      if hasSwiftDataWorkout { return true }
      // Then check HealthKit (all apps)
      return await healthKitService.hasWorkoutToday()
  }

  Phase 3: Enhanced Activity Context ✅

      // NEW: Enhanced activity fields from HealthKit
      let exerciseMinutes: Int?           // Apple Exercise Time
      let activeCalories: Double?         // Workout calories burned
      let stepGoalProgress: Double?       // Progress toward daily steps
      let yesterdayWorkoutCount: Int?     // Previous day activity
  }

  📋 DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS & PATTERNS

  Build & Test Commands

  # After file changes
  xcodegen generate && swiftlint --strict

  # Build & test
  xcodebuild clean build -scheme "AirFit" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro,OS=18.4'

  # Search for TODOs
  grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK" --include="*.swift" AirFit/

  # Find services needing updates
  grep -rL "ServiceProtocol" --include="*.swift" AirFit/Services/

  Architecture Patterns

  // Service Pattern (ALL 45+ services use this)
  actor MyService: MyServiceProtocol, ServiceProtocol {
      nonisolated let serviceIdentifier = "my-service"
      nonisolated var isConfigured: Bool { true }

      func configure() async throws { /* setup */ }
      func reset() async { /* cleanup */ }
      func healthCheck() async -> ServiceHealth { /* status */ }
  }

  // Error Handling (100% adoption)
  throw AppError.networkError(message: "Description")

  // DI Pattern (Lazy factory with async resolution)
  let service = await container.resolve(MyServiceProtocol.self)
