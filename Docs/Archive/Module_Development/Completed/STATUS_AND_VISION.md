# Persona Refactor - Status & Vision

## üöÄ Quick Status Check
```bash
# Check implementation status
cd /Users/Brian/Coding\ Projects/AirFit
ls -la AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Models/ConversationModels.swift 2>/dev/null || echo "‚ùå Phase 1 not started"
ls -la AirFit/Modules/AI/PersonaSynthesis/PersonaSynthesizer.swift 2>/dev/null || echo "‚ùå Phase 2 not started"

# Check existing persona code
cat AirFit/Modules/AI/PersonaEngine.swift | head -20  # Current 4-persona system
ls AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Views/PersonaSelectionView.swift  # Current selection UI
```

## üìç Current State (V1.0 Still in development, implemented Airfit/docs/Module0.md-Module8.5 as well as Module 13)
### What Exists Now
- **4 Discrete Personas**: Supportive, Direct, Analytical, Motivational
- **Selection UI**: Grid-based tap selection (`PersonaSelectionView.swift`)
- **Token Efficiency**: ~600 tokens (optimized from 2000)
- **Performance**: <2ms prompt generation

### Implementation Status
- üöß **Phase 1**: ConversationModels.swift - NOT STARTED
- üöß **Phase 2**: PersonaSynthesizer.swift - NOT STARTED  
- üöß **Phase 3**: Integration - NOT STARTED
- üöß **Phase 4**: Polish - NOT STARTED

*Note: Recent "Phase 4 Complete" commits refer to previous AI optimization, not this persona refactor*

## üéØ Target Vision (V2.0 - Conversational)
### What We're Building
- **Infinite Unique Personas**: AI-synthesized through natural conversation
- **Natural Onboarding**: 8-10 turn chat that feels like texting a friend
- **Rich Personalities**: 2000+ tokens of nuanced character
- **Continuous Evolution**: Personas that learn and adapt
- **Generation Time**: <5 seconds with multi-LLM synthesis

## üîÑ Migration Strategy
### Keep & Extend
- ‚úÖ Current PersonaMode as "quick mode" fallback
- ‚úÖ Existing chat infrastructure (ChatViewModel, ChatMessage)
- ‚úÖ CoachEngine for response generation
- ‚úÖ SwiftData models (extend, don't replace)

### Build New
- üÜï ConversationFlow state machine
- üÜï PersonaSynthesis pipeline
- üÜï Natural conversation UI
- üÜï Real-time preview during generation

## üí° The Vibe Difference
| Current V1.0 | Target V2.0 |
|--------------|-------------|
| "Pick your coach" | "Let's get to know each other" |
| 2 second selection | 2-3 minute conversation |
| Generic persona | Unique relationship |
| Tool | Companion |
