# AI System Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Status**: Pre-MVP Implementation Required  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Core functionality is fake/incomplete

## Executive Summary

The AirFit AI system has solid infrastructure but critical user-facing features are either fake or incomplete. The dashboard shows hardcoded time-based messages instead of AI insights, and many "AI-powered" features fall back to templates without user awareness. We have excellent structured output support that isn't being utilized.

## Current State Analysis

### âœ… Working Well
- **Infrastructure**: LLMOrchestrator, multi-provider support, fallback logic
- **Structured Outputs**: Implemented for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini (99.9% reliability)
- **Onboarding**: Solid conversational flow with context tracking
- **Persona Generation**: Quality-first approach using frontier models
- **Nutrition Parsing**: Successfully migrated from hardcoded values to real AI

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issues
1. **Fake Dashboard AI**: Returns time-based strings, no actual AI
2. **Missing Methods**: CoachEngine.generateNotificationContent() doesn't exist
3. **Performance**: Context assembly doing heavy operations on main thread
4. **Silent Failures**: AI failures return templates without user awareness
5. **Unused Infrastructure**: Structured outputs not used where needed most

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Fake Features (Week 1)
**Goal**: Remove embarrassing fake AI, implement real features

#### 1.1 Dashboard AI Content (2 days)
```swift
// Current (FAKE):

    let primaryInsight: String
    let nutritionGuidance: NutritionGuidance?
    let workoutMotivation: String?
    let celebration: Achievement?
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Structured Output Schemas

```swift
// Dashboard Content Schema
let dashboardSchema = StructuredOutputSchema.fromJSON(
    name: "dashboard_content",
    description: "Generate personalized dashboard content",
    schema: [
        "type": "object",
        "properties": [
            "primaryInsight": [
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Main personalized message (2-3 sentences)"
            ],
            "nutritionGuidance": [
                "type": "object",
                "properties": [
                    "message": ["type": "string"],
                    "remainingCalories": ["type": "number"],
                    "nextMealSuggestion": ["type": "string"]
                ]
            ],
            "workoutMotivation": [
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Workout-related encouragement"
            ],
            "microAchievement": [
                "type": "object",
                "properties": [
                    "title": ["type": "string"],
                    "description": ["type": "string"],
                    "emoji": ["type": "string"]
                ]
            ]
        ],
        "required": ["primaryInsight"]
    ]
)

// Goal Progress Schema
let goalProgressSchema = StructuredOutputSchema.fromJSON(
    name: "goal_progress_analysis",
    description: "Analyze goal progress and provide insights",
    schema: [
        "type": "object",
        "properties": [
            "progressSummary": ["type": "string"],
            "adjustments": [
                "type": "array",
                "items": [
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": [
                        "type": ["type": "string", "enum": ["timeline", "target", "approach"]],
                        "recommendation": ["type": "string"],
                        "rationale": ["type": "string"]
                    ]
                ]
            ],
            "predictedCompletion": [

                    "confidence": ["type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 1]
                ]
            ],
            "motivationalMessage": ["type": "string"]
        ],
        "required": ["progressSummary", "motivationalMessage"]
    ]
)
```

### Context Assembly Optimization

```swift
// Optimized workout context fetching
private func fetchRecentWorkouts(
    context: ModelContext,
    limit: Int = 10,
    daysBack: Int = 30
) async -> [Workout] {
    let cutoffDate = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: -daysBack, to: Date())!
    
    return await Task.detached {
        let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Workout>(
            predicate: #Predicate { workout in
                workout.completedDate != nil && 
                workout.completedDate! >= cutoffDate
            },
            sortBy: [SortDescriptor(\.completedDate, order: .reverse)]
        )
        descriptor.fetchLimit = limit
        
        return try? context.fetch(descriptor) ?? []
    }.value
}
```

### AI Service Telemetry

```swift
struct AITelemetry {
    static func recordAIOperation(
        feature: String,
        success: Bool,
        latencyMs: Int,
        provider: String,
        fallbackUsed: Bool = false
    ) {
        AppLogger.info(
            "AI Operation",
            metadata: [
                "feature": feature,
                "success": success,
                "latency_ms": latencyMs,
                "provider": provider,
                "fallback_used": fallbackUsed
            ],
            category: .ai
        )
        
        // Send to analytics service
        Task {
            await AnalyticsService.shared.track(
                event: "ai_operation",
                properties: [
                    "feature": feature,
                    "success": success,
                    "latency_ms": latencyMs,
                    "provider": provider,
                    "fallback_used": fallbackUsed
                ]
            )
        }
    }
}
```

## Success Metrics

### Week 1
- [ ] Zero fake AI responses in production
- [ ] Dashboard shows real AI insights with <3s latency
- [ ] All AI failures are tracked and visible

### Week 2
- [ ] Context assembly off main thread
- [ ] 95%+ structured output parsing success
- [ ] Users can see when content is AI vs template

### Week 3
- [ ] Dashboard insights reference actual user data
- [ ] Workout recommendations adapt to recovery
- [ ] Nutrition suggestions are contextually relevant

### Week 4+
- [ ] 50% reduction in template fallback usage
- [ ] User engagement with AI features >80%
- [ ] AI response latency <2s for all features

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Performance**: Profile all AI operations, add caching where appropriate
2. **Cost**: Monitor token usage, implement smart batching
3. **Reliability**: Always have graceful fallbacks, but make them visible
4. **User Trust**: Never show fake AI content, be transparent about failures

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start with Dashboard AI (most visible fake feature)
2. **This Week**: Implement all Phase 1 tasks
3. **Review**: Daily standups on AI implementation progress
4. **Testing**: Each feature needs real user testing before ship

**Remember**: We're building trust. Better to show "Content unavailable" than fake AI responses. Every interaction should feel magical or honest, never fake.
