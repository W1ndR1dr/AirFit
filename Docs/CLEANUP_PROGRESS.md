# CLEANUP_PROGRESS.md

## Overview
Tracking the removal of all technical debt, mocks, and obsolete code as we integrate o3 pro's superior implementations.

## Cleanup Log

### 2025-01-18: Initial Cleanup Campaign

#### âœ… Completed
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md with cleanup tracking system
- [x] Created this progress file
- [x] Fixed HealthKitError references (no more HealthKitManager.HealthKitError)
- [x] Created missing model types (NutritionMetrics, HealthKitNutritionSummary, DailyBiometrics)
- [x] Fixed non-Sendable closure issues
- [x] Replaced old HealthKit methods with o3 pro's optimized versions
- [x] Fixed all RecoveryDataAdapter type conversion issues
- [x] Fixed all async/await issues with RecoveryInference
- [x] Fixed ContextAssembler concurrency issues
- [x] Removed WorkoutListView preview mocks
- [x] BUILD SUCCEEDED! ðŸŽ‰

### 2025-01-18: Cleanup Phase 1
- [x] MockRecoveryService - Already removed
- [x] Mock recovery data in RecoveryDetailView - Replaced with empty array
- [x] MockContextAssembler/MockHealthKitManager - Already commented out
- [x] Task.sleep delays - Reviewed, all legitimate (retries, demo mode, UI feedback)

#### ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] Standardize recovery status enums
- [ ] Remove duplicate HealthKit query methods
- [ ] Delete old manual caching implementations

#### ðŸ“‹ Queued for Deletion

**Recovery System**
- `MockRecoveryService` - OBSOLETE: Replaced by RecoveryInference
- Mock recovery data in RecoveryDetailView (lines 482-503) - OBSOLETE: Use real RecoveryInference
- Old recovery status enums - OBSOLETE: Conflicts with RecoveryInference types

**HealthKit System**
- Duplicate HealthKit query methods - OBSOLETE: o3 pro's are better optimized
- Manual caching implementations - OBSOLETE: Replaced by HealthKitCacheActor
- `HealthKitManager.HealthKitError` references - OBSOLETE: Use standalone HealthKitError

**Dashboard**
- `MockContextAssembler` - OBSOLETE: Never implemented, referenced in preview
- `MockHealthKitManager` - OBSOLETE: Never implemented, referenced in preview
- Hardcoded recovery scores - OBSOLETE: Calculate from real data

**Onboarding**
- Fake progress simulation code - OBSOLETE: We have real progress now
- Sleep delays - OBSOLETE: Artificial delays harm UX
- Manual state management - OBSOLETE: Replaced by OnboardingStateMachine

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify mock removal
grep -r "Mock" --include="*.swift" AirFit/ | wc -l  # Should decrease to near 0

# Verify no more fake delays
grep -r "Task\.sleep" --include="*.swift" AirFit/  # Should be empty

# Verify error cleanup
grep -r "HealthKitManager\.HealthKitError" --include="*.swift" AirFit/  # Should be 0
```

## Build Health
- Last successful build: 2025-01-18 âœ… BUILD SUCCEEDED
- Current errors: 0
- Current warnings: ~10 (mostly unused async warnings in WatchKit)

## Next Steps
1. Fix HealthKit build errors
2. Start systematic deletion of mocks
3. Update all previews to use real data or remove them
