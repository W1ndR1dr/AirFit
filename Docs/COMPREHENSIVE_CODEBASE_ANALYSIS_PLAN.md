## Synthesis Plan

After all 15 agents complete their analysis, we will:

1. **Create Master Architecture Document**: Synthesize all findings into a comprehensive architecture guide
2. **Identify Key Issues**: Compile all identified problems with severity ratings
3. **Architecture Recommendations**: Propose improvements based on findings
4. **Migration Plan**: Create a phased plan to address issues
5. **Best Practices Guide**: Document patterns to follow going forward

## Expected Outcomes

This comprehensive analysis will provide:
- Complete understanding of the codebase architecture
- Detailed documentation of all systems and patterns
- Identified issues and technical debt
- Clear path forward for improvements
- Foundation for future development decisions

---

**Note to Agents**: Focus on understanding and documenting what EXISTS in the code. Be specific with file references and line numbers. Document both the good and the problematic. Your analysis will form the foundation for all future architectural decisions.
