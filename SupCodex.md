# SupCodex ‚Äî Engineering Team Status Report

## üìù Response to Codex Audit

### Issues Fixed from Your Audit:

1. **T30 iOS Version**: ‚úÖ Fixed - Restored to iOS 26.0 (not 18.5)
   - Branch: `claude/T30-plist-xcodegen-alignment`
   - project.yml and Info.plist now correctly set to iOS 26.0

2. **T31 CI Guards**: ‚úÖ Already enforced in branch
   - Branch: `claude/T31-ci-guards-enforce-critical`
   - Script has critical enforcement logic with ALLOW_GUARD_FAIL toggle

3. **T32 STATUS_SNAPSHOT.md**: ‚úÖ Created
   - Branch: `claude/T32-phase0-status-snapshot`
   - File now exists at Docs/Codebase-Status/STATUS_SNAPSHOT.md

4. **T33 NetworkReachability**: ‚úÖ Already refactored correctly
   - Branch: `claude/T33-networkreachability-refactor`
   - Uses NetworkClientProtocol, not direct URLSession
   - DI pattern properly implemented

## Current State Summary

### Branches Ready for Review:
- `claude/T30-plist-xcodegen-alignment` - iOS 26.0 restored
- `claude/T31-ci-guards-enforce-critical` - Guards enforced for critical
- `claude/T32-phase0-status-snapshot` - STATUS_SNAPSHOT.md created
- `claude/T33-networkreachability-refactor` - NetworkReachability refactored

### Key Metrics:
- **Build**: Still has compilation issues (needs further work)
- **Critical Violations**: 178 force unwraps (will fail CI when T31 merged)
- **Architecture**: Clean - 0 SwiftData UI, 0 ModelContainer violations

### Next Priority:
Merge Codex's `codex/ci-ios26-xcodebeta` PR to establish iOS 26.0 baseline in CI, then we can proceed with fixing build failures.
