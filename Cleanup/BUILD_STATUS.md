# Build Status & Next Steps

## Current State
- ~18 compilation failures remaining (down from hundreds)
- Major refactoring complete: CoachEngine Combine → AsyncThrowingStream
- All force casts eliminated

## Remaining Issues Pattern
Most errors follow these patterns:
1. Missing properties on data models (biologicalSex, goal enums)
2. Protocol method signature mismatches
3. Async operation warnings (cosmetic)

## Fix Strategy
1. Run focused error grep: `xcodebuild ... 2>&1 | grep "error:" | grep -v "__swiftmacro"`
2. Group errors by file/type
3. Fix systematically with consistent patterns:
   - Missing properties → Add with sensible defaults or compute from available data
   - Protocol mismatches → Update implementations to match protocol signatures
   - Type mismatches → Check actual types in model files, not assumptions

## Key Decisions Made
- OfflineAIService retained as production fallback
- Simplified nutrition calculations to work with available data
- AsyncThrowingStream pattern applied consistently

## Critical Files
- CoachEngine.swift - streaming refactored ✓
- DefaultHealthKitService.swift - property mappings fixed ✓
- DefaultDashboardNutritionService.swift - needs goal enum fixes
- Protocol definitions in Core/Protocols/

## Next Build Command
```bash
cd "/Users/Brian/Coding Projects/AirFit"
xcodegen generate  # If files added/moved
xcodebuild build -scheme "AirFit" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro,OS=18.4'
```
