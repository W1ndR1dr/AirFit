## What is AirFit?

AirFit is a revolutionary fitness app that combines the power of artificial intelligence with the convenience of voice control. Unlike traditional fitness apps where you manually log everything, AirFit lets you simply talk to your personal AI coach about your meals, workouts, and wellness goals.

### Key Features:

- **Voice-First Design**: Log meals and activities by simply speaking
- **Smart Nutrition Tracking**: Automatically calculates calories and macros from your descriptions
- **Workout Management**: Custom workout plans and real-time tracking
- **Health Integration**: Syncs with Apple Health for a complete picture of your wellness
- **Apple Watch Support**: Track workouts directly from your wrist

## Getting Started

### First-Time Setup

When you first open AirFit, you'll go through a friendly conversation with the app to set up your personalized experience:

1. **Welcome Screen**: You'll see a welcome message introducing you to AirFit
2. **Conversational Onboarding**: The app will chat with you to understand:
   - Your fitness goals (weight loss, muscle gain, general health, etc.)
   - Your current activity level
   - Dietary preferences or restrictions
   - Your preferred coaching style (motivating, gentle, analytical, etc.)
3. **Health Permissions**: Grant access to Apple Health to enable automatic syncing
4. **AI Coach Creation**: Based on your responses, AirFit creates your personalized AI coach
5. **Coach Preview**: Review your coach's personality and make adjustments if needed

The entire process takes about 5-10 minutes and feels like chatting with a friend rather than filling out forms.
