Okay, this is a significant undertaking, and you're absolutely right to think about it in terms of a "recipe" for AI agents. Structuring this for AI-driven development requires extreme clarity, modularity, and an understanding of dependencies.

Given you don't code, I'll aim for a level of detail that is conceptually clear but also provides enough specificity that an AI code generation agent (like a sophisticated version of Codex) could interpret it. I'll also highlight parallel vs. sequential tasks.

**Important Caveats for AI Agent-Driven Development:**

*   **Agent Capabilities:** The success heavily relies on the capabilities of these AI agents. They need to understand context, maintain consistency across files, handle complex instructions, and ideally, be ableto test their own code.
*   **Human Oversight & Iteration:** Even with advanced AI, human oversight, review, and iterative refinement will be ESSENTIAL. You'll act as the "product owner" and "QA lead."
*   **Prompt Engineering for Agents:** Each task for an agent will require careful "prompt engineering" â€“ providing clear instructions, context, and expected outputs.
*   **State Management Between Agents/Tasks:** This is a huge challenge. How does Agent B know what Agent A did perfectly? This often requires a robust version control system (like Git) and potentially a shared understanding of the evolving codebase or very well-defined interfaces between modules.
*   **Code Style & Linting:** We can *specify* a code style, but enforcement will require tools (linters, formatters) that the agents (or a subsequent automated step) would use.

Let's structure this:

**I. AirFit App - Master Architecture Specification (v1.2)**

**Version:** 1.2
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** May 24, 2025
**Purpose:** This document defines the overall software architecture for the AirFit application. It outlines the major components, their responsibilities, interactions, and the foundational principles guiding development. This master document serves as the central reference for all modular sub-documents containing detailed tasks for AI development agents.

**1. Guiding Architectural Principles**

*   **Modularity & Separation of Concerns:** The system will be built as a collection of loosely coupled modules, each with a distinct responsibility. This facilitates parallel development, testability, and maintainability.
*   **Scalability & Maintainability:** Design choices should support future growth in features and user load without requiring major architectural overhauls. Clean code and clear interfaces are paramount.
*   **Testability:** All modules and components must be designed with testability in mind. Unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests will be integral to the development process.
*   **Platform Best Practices:** Adherence to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and platform-specific (iOS, WatchOS) best practices for Swift, SwiftUI, SwiftData, HealthKit, etc.
*   **Security & Privacy by Design:** Security and privacy considerations are embedded in the architecture from the ground up, not as an afterthought.
*   **Clarity for AI Agents:** All specifications must be explicit, unambiguous, and provide sufficient context for AI code generation agents.

**2. Technology Stack (Apple Ecosystem)**

*   **Programming Language:** Swift (latest stable version)
*   **UI Framework:** SwiftUI (for both iOS and WatchOS)
*   **Data Persistence:** SwiftData
*   **Health Data:** HealthKit, WorkoutKit
*   **Networking:** URLSession, Async/Await
*   **On-Device Transcription:** WhisperKit (or similar on-device speech recognition framework compatible with Swift)
*   **AI Model Interaction:** Via a secure backend service (AI-Router). Gemini 1.5 Flash (or specified model) will be the primary LLM.
*   **Version Control:** Git (essential for iterative development and agent collaboration)
*   **Dependency Management:** Swift Package Manager (SPM)

**3. Overall System Architecture (Layered Approach)**

As defined in the Design Spec v1.2:

*   **Presentation Layer (SwiftUI):**
    *   Responsible for rendering all UI elements, capturing user input, and displaying data.
    *   Views will be lightweight and primarily driven by state from ViewModels or direct SwiftData queries.
    *   **Code Style:** Follow Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines. Use clear, descriptive names for views, variables, and functions. Prefer composition over inheritance for views. Utilize previews extensively for UI development.
*   **Business Logic Layer (BLL):**
    *   Contains the core application logic, orchestrates data flow between the Presentation and Data/Service layers.
    *   Key Components: `CoachEngine`, `WorkoutGenerator`, `OnboardingManager`, `NutritionLogOrchestrator`, local parsers for simple commands.
    *   **Code Style:** Logic should be encapsulated in classes or structs with clear responsibilities. Use protocols to define contracts between components. Emphasize immutability where possible.
*   **Service Layer:**
    *   Manages all interactions with external systems and platform services.
    *   Key Components: `HealthKitManager`, `WeatherServiceAPIClient`, `AIRouterService`, `WhisperServiceWrapper`, `NotificationService`.
    *   **Code Style:** Each service should implement a clearly defined protocol. Handle errors gracefully using Swift's error handling mechanisms (try/catch, Result types). All network requests must be asynchronous.
*   **Data Layer (SwiftData):**
    *   The single source of truth for all persisted application data.
    *   Includes SwiftData Models (as defined in v1.1 and updated for Persona Blueprint Flow v3.1), and potentially manager classes for complex queries or data migrations if needed.
    *   **Code Style:** Model definitions should be clear and directly reflect the schema. Use `@Attribute` and `@Relationship` property wrappers as intended.

**4. Core Modules & Their Interactions (High-Level Overview)**

*(Each of these would become a detailed sub-document with specific tasks)*

*   **A. Project Setup & Core Utilities (Sequential - Foundational)**
    *   Initialize Git repository.
    *   Setup Xcode project structure (folders for Layers, Modules, Shared Utilities).
    *   Define global constants, theme (colors, fonts for SwiftUI), and utility extensions.
    *   Integrate basic logging framework.
    *   Setup SwiftLint and SwiftFormat with a defined configuration file to enforce code style.

*   **B. Data Layer Module (Sequential - Foundational)**
    *   Define all SwiftData `@Model` classes (User, OnboardingProfile, FoodEntry, Workout, CoachMessage, etc.) precisely as per schema.
    *   Implement any necessary custom initializers or helper methods within models.
    *   (Later) Implement data migration strategies if schema evolves.

*   **C. Onboarding Module (Parallel with D, E after B is complete)**
    *   Implement SwiftUI views for each screen of the "Persona Blueprint Flow v3.1".
    *   Develop `OnboardingViewModel` or manager to handle state, navigation, and data collection during onboarding.
    *   Logic to process user inputs, make LLM Call 1 (Goal Analysis), and construct the `persona_profile.json`.
    *   Save `OnboardingProfile` to SwiftData upon completion.

*   **D. HealthKit & Context Aggregation Module (Parallel with C, E after B is complete)**
    *   Implement `HealthKitManager` service to request permissions, fetch, and (where appropriate) save HealthKit data (sleep, workouts, RHR, HRV, etc.).
    *   Develop `ContextAssembler` service to gather data from HealthKit, in-app logs (e.g., `DailyLog`), and device sensors (e.g., weather via `WeatherServiceAPIClient`) to create the `HealthContextSnapshot`.

*   **E. AI Persona Engine & CoachEngine (Parallel with C, D after B and basic Services in J are sketched)**
    *   Develop `CoachEngine` class responsible for orchestrating AI chat interactions.
    *   Implement local pre-parser for simple commands.
    *   Logic for constructing prompts (injecting `persona_profile.json`, `HealthContextSnapshot`, `conversationHistory`, `AvailableHighValueFunctions` into the master system prompt template).
    *   Interaction with `AIRouterService`.
    *   Handling text responses and function call requests from the LLM.
    *   Saving `CoachMessage` entities.

*   **F. Services Layer - Part 1 (API Clients & Wrappers) (Parallel with C, D, E after A)**
    *   Implement `WeatherServiceAPIClient`.
    *   Implement `WhisperServiceWrapper` (for on-device speech-to-text).
    *   Develop a mock `AIRouterService` for initial testing before backend is ready.

*   **G. Dashboard Module (Sequential after C, D, E are partially functional)**
    *   SwiftUI views for the Dashboard (`LazyVGrid`, `MorningGreetingCard`, `NutritionCard`, etc.).
    *   `DashboardViewModel` to fetch and prepare data for display, including triggering AI for the Morning Greeting.

*   **H. Workout Logging Module (iOS & WatchOS) (Parallel with G, I)**
    *   **WatchOS App:** Target for WatchOS, SwiftUI views for active workout, set logging, HealthKit integration via `WorkoutKit`.
    *   **iOS Views:** Workout history, workout summary view (displaying AI-generated summary).
    *   Logic for AI Post-Workout Analysis (triggered by `CoachEngine` or a dedicated manager).

*   **I. Nutrition Logging Module (Parallel with G, H)**
    *   SwiftUI views for nutrition logging, displaying macro rings (data from `NutritionCard` on Dashboard might share logic).
    *   Voice input capture UI.
    *   Integration with `WhisperServiceWrapper`.
    *   Orchestration logic (`NutritionLogOrchestrator`): deciding if local parsing is sufficient or if `parseAndLogComplexNutrition` function call to `CoachEngine` is needed.
    *   UI for confirming/editing LLM-parsed food items.

*   **J. Services Layer - Part 2 (AI-Router Full Implementation) (Sequential, requires backend counterpart)**
    *   Full implementation of `AIRouterService` to securely communicate with the actual AI backend (which routes to Gemini etc.).
    *   Handle authentication, request formatting, response parsing (streaming text, function call structures).

*   **K. Notifications & Engagement Engine (Parallel with G, H, I, late stage)**
    *   Implement `UNUserNotificationCenter` delegate methods.
    *   Develop `EngageEngine` for lapse detection (background task) and triggering AI-generated notifications via `CoachEngine`.
    *   Logic for actionable notifications.

*   **L. Settings Module (Parallel with G, H, I, late stage)**
    *   SwiftUI views for various settings screens (e.g., review/refine persona, notification preferences, units, HealthKit permissions, privacy info, export data).
    *   ViewModels to manage and save settings.

*   **M. Testing & Quality Assurance Framework (Continuous & Parallel throughout)**
    *   Setup XCTest targets for unit and UI tests.
    *   Define strategy for mocking services and data for testing.
    *   AI agents should be tasked to write unit tests for their generated code (business logic, view models).
    *   (Human task) Define key user flows for UI testing.

**5. Data Flow Examples (Illustrative)**

*   **User Sends Complex Chat Message:**
    1.  SwiftUI View -> `CoachEngine`.LocalPreParser (no match)
    2.  `CoachEngine` -> `ContextAssembler` (gets `HealthContextSnapshot`)
    3.  `CoachEngine` -> SwiftData (gets `OnboardingProfile`, `conversationHistory`)
    4.  `CoachEngine` -> Constructs prompt -> `AIRouterService`
    5.  `AIRouterService` -> AI Backend (LLM)
    6.  AI Backend -> `AIRouterService` (response: text or function call)
    7.  `AIRouterService` -> `CoachEngine`
    8.  If text: `CoachEngine` -> Publishes to SwiftUI View, Saves `CoachMessage`.
    9.  If function call: `CoachEngine` -> Relevant App Module (e.g., `WorkoutGenerator`) -> (potentially back to `CoachEngine` to inform LLM of result) -> `CoachEngine` -> Publishes to SwiftUI View, Saves `CoachMessage`.

**6. Code Style and Conventions (To be enforced via SwiftLint/Format and Agent Instructions)**

*   **Language:** Swift (latest stable).
*   **Style Guide:** Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines. Additions:
    *   **Naming:** Descriptive (e.g., `UserProfileView`, `fetchWeatherData()`). PascalCase for types, camelCase for functions/variables.
    *   **Comments:** Explain *why*, not *what*, if code isn't self-explanatory. Use `MARK:` for organizing code.
    *   **Error Handling:** Prefer `Result` type for asynchronous operations that can fail. Use `do-catch` for throwing functions. Avoid force unwrapping (`!`) and force casting (`as!`).
    *   **Immutability:** Prefer `let` over `var`. Use immutable data structures where practical.
    *   **SwiftUI:** Create small, reusable views. Use `@State`, `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, `@EnvironmentObject`, `@Query` appropriately. Previews are mandatory for all views.
    *   **Concurrency:** Use `async/await` for asynchronous code. Use Actors for managing shared mutable state if necessary.
*   **Project Structure:**
    *   Organize files by feature/module first, then by type (e.g., `AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/Views/WelcomeView.swift`, `AirFit/Modules/Onboarding/ViewModels/OnboardingViewModel.swift`).
    *   Shared utilities in a `Shared` or `Common` group.
*   **Agent Instructions for Code Generation:**
    *   "Generate Swift code for a SwiftUI view named `[ViewName]` with the following elements and functionality..."
    *   "Implement a service class `[ServiceName]` conforming to `[ProtocolName]` with methods to..."
    *   "Write unit tests for `[ClassName.methodName]` covering the following scenarios..."
    *   "Ensure all generated code adheres to the project's SwiftLint configuration."

**7. Sequencing and Parallelization Strategy for AI Agents**

*   **Phase 1: Foundation (Mostly Sequential)**
    1.  Task A: Project Setup & Core Utilities (Agent 1)
    2.  Task B: Data Layer Module (SwiftData Models) (Agent 1 or 2)
    3.  Task F (Partial): Mock Services Interfaces (`AIRouterService` mock, `HealthKitManager` mock) (Agent 2)
*   **Phase 2: Core Modules - Iteration 1 (Parallel)**
    1.  Task C: Onboarding Module (UI views, basic ViewModel) (Agent 1)
    2.  Task D: HealthKit & Context Aggregation (Basic `HealthKitManager` setup, `ContextAssembler` skeleton) (Agent 2)
    3.  Task E: AI Persona Engine & CoachEngine (Basic prompt construction, interaction with mock `AIRouterService`) (Agent 3)
*   **Phase 3: Feature Prototyping & Integration - Iteration 1 (Parallel, with dependencies)**
    1.  Task G: Dashboard Module (Basic UI, connect to mock data or early `ContextAssembler`) (Agent 1, depends on C, D partial)
    2.  Task H (iOS part): Workout Logging (Basic UI for history, connect to mock data) (Agent 2)
    3.  Task I: Nutrition Logging (Basic UI, voice capture stub) (Agent 3)

    2.  Task J: `AIRouterService` full implementation (requires backend) (Agent 2, or specialized backend agent)
    3.  Refine Task E: `CoachEngine` full logic, function call handling (Agent 3, depends on J)
*   **Phase 5: Full Feature Implementation & WatchOS (Parallel)**
    1.  Complete Task C, D, G, H (iOS), I with real data and AI integration. (Multiple agents)
    2.  Task H (WatchOS part): Develop WatchOS app. (Specialized Agent/Team)
    3.  Task K: Notifications & Engagement Engine. (Agent)
    4.  Task L: Settings Module. (Agent)
*   **Continuous Task M: Testing (All Agents, Human QA)**

**8. Modularity & Sub-Documents Strategy**

This Master Architecture document provides the high-level blueprint. For each major Module/Task (e.g., "C. Onboarding Module," "D. HealthKit & Context Aggregation Module"), a **separate, highly detailed sub-document** will be created.

**Each Modular Sub-Document will contain:**

1.  **Module Overview:** Purpose, responsibilities, key components within the module.
2.  **Dependencies:** Which other modules/tasks it depends on (inputs) and which depend on it (outputs).
3.  **Detailed Component Specifications:**
    *   For UI Views: Mockups/wireframes (from Design Spec), list of UI elements, expected user interactions, state variables, data bindings.
    *   For ViewModels/Managers: Properties, methods (with signatures: parameters, return types), logic to be implemented, error handling.
    *   For Services: Protocol definition, method signatures, expected behavior, interaction with external APIs/SDKs.
    *   For Data Models: (Reference to central Data Layer spec).
4.  **Specific Agent Tasks (Numbered List):**
    *   Clear, actionable, and scoped tasks for AI agents. E.g.:
        *   "1.1 Create a SwiftUI View named `WelcomeScreenView.swift` according to Onboarding Flow Screen 1. It should contain Text elements for title and subtitle, and a Button for 'Begin'."
        *   "1.2 Implement a function `func collectLifeSnapshotData(selections: [LifeSnapshotOption])` in `OnboardingViewModel.swift`."
        *   "1.3 Write three unit tests for `OnboardingViewModel.validateGoalText()`."
5.  **Acceptance Criteria for each task/component:** How to verify it's done correctly.
6.  **Code Style Reminders specific to the module.**

---

This Master Architecture provides the skeleton. The real "meat" for the AI agents will be in those hyper-detailed modular sub-documents. You, as the project lead, will need to manage the creation of these sub-documents, oversee the AI agents' work, review their outputs, and manage the integration of different modules.

This is an ambitious but structured approach. The key will be the quality of the sub-document specifications and the capabilities of your AI development agents.
